/// <para>
/// The command identifies its leaf resource via the existing
/// <see cref="IIdentifyResource{TResource, TId}"/> interface (or supplies a custom
/// <see cref="IResourceLoader{TMessage, TResource}"/>); this interface declares only the
/// final authorization target. The path from leaf to <typeparamref name="TOwner"/> is
/// resolved at registration time from the entity-side
/// <see cref="IIdentifyRelatedResource{TRelated, TId}"/> /
/// <see cref="IIdentifyRelatedResources{TRelated, TId}"/> declarations.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Authorize"/> always receives <see cref="IReadOnlyList{TOwner}"/>:
/// size 1 for chains whose terminal hop is singular, size N for chains whose terminal
/// hop is plural (fan-out, e.g. cricket "actor owns home OR away team"). The framework
/// does not impose the operator over the list; the command's <see cref="Authorize"/>
/// method picks <c>Any</c>, <c>All</c>, or any other shape.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Implementing both <see cref="IAuthorizeResource{TResource}"/> and
/// <see cref="IAuthorizeResourceVia{TOwner}"/> on the same command is rejected at

/// <para>
/// Cases not expressible by the navigation-chain model — composite keys, joins,
/// projections, conditional / data-dependent paths, recursive hierarchies, or
/// authorization needing multiple heterogeneous resources at once — should fall back
/// to a custom <see cref="IResourceLoader{TMessage, TResource}"/> that returns a
/// projection type, plus <see cref="IAuthorizeResource{TResource}"/> on the command
/// over that projection.
