# Trellis Cross-Package Cookbook

- **Audience:** AI coding agents (and humans) writing Trellis code from documentation alone.
- **Purpose:** End-to-end recipes that cross package boundaries — DDD, Mediator, FluentValidation, EF Core, ASP.NET Core, Authorization, State Machine, Testing, Analyzers — using the *exact* public surface listed in the per-package API references.
- **Companion docs:**
  - [trellis-api-core.md](trellis-api-core.md) — `Result<T>`, `Maybe<T>`, errors, primitives, pagination
  - [trellis-api-primitives.md](trellis-api-primitives.md) — `RequiredString`, `RequiredGuid`, `[Range]`, `[StringLength]`
  - [trellis-api-mediator.md](trellis-api-mediator.md) — `ICommand<T>`, `IQuery<T>`, `IPipelineBehavior<,>`, `AddTrellisBehaviors`
  - [trellis-api-fluentvalidation.md](trellis-api-fluentvalidation.md) — `AddTrellisFluentValidation`
  - [trellis-api-efcore.md](trellis-api-efcore.md) — `SaveChangesResultAsync`, `MaybePropertyMapping`, `RepositoryBase<TAggregate,TId>`
  - [trellis-api-asp.md](trellis-api-asp.md) — `ToHttpResponse`, `HttpResponseOptionsBuilder<T>`, `AddTrellisAsp`, `AsActionResult`

  - [trellis-api-analyzers.md](trellis-api-analyzers.md) — `TRLS001`-`TRLS039`, `TrellisDiagnosticIds`

## How to read these recipes

Every recipe follows the same shape:

1. **Problem statement** — what the consumer is trying to accomplish.
2. **Solution code** — copy-pasteable C# that compiles against the documented public surface only. No invented APIs.
3. **What it shows** — the cross-cutting concept being demonstrated.
4. **Anti-pattern → fix** *(when applicable)* — the wrong way and which Trellis analyzer catches it.

Conventions used throughout:

- All Trellis types live in the `Trellis` namespace except where called out (`Trellis.Asp`, `Trellis.Asp.Authorization`, `Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Trellis.Analyzers`).
- Snippets use C# 12+ features (file-scoped namespaces, primary constructors, collection expressions) — Trellis targets `net10.0`.
- `Result.Ok` / `Result.Fail` are *the* construction APIs. `default(Result<T>)` is a typed failure; do not rely on it as success.
- Every async pipeline uses `*Async` extensions; mixing sync chain methods with `Task<Result<T>>` triggers `TRLS009`.
- Examples reference an `OrderId : RequiredGuid<OrderId>` value object and an `Order` aggregate. Substitute your own types without changing the structure.

## LLM preflight: load the smallest correct reference set

Before writing Trellis code, choose the task in the lookup table below, then load only the package references needed for that task. The cookbook gives the end-to-end recipe; the package references are the source of truth for exact signatures, overloads, ordering, and edge-case behavior.

| If you are changing... | Load these references before coding | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Result, Maybe, errors, value-object bases, aggregates, specifications, pagination | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-core.md` | Core owns the ROP primitives and DDD base types used by every package. |
| ASP.NET endpoints, controllers, response mapping, ETags, Prefer, ranges, actor providers | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-asp.md`, `trellis-api-core.md`; add `trellis-api-mediator.md` when endpoints send messages | `ToHttpResponse` and scalar validation are ASP-owned, while handlers and result shapes come from Core/Mediator. |
| Mediator handlers, pipeline behaviors, validation, authorization, domain events | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-mediator.md`, `trellis-api-core.md`; add `trellis-api-efcore.md` for unit-of-work and `trellis-api-authorization.md` for resource guards | Pipeline ordering and opt-in behaviors are cross-package; missing one reference usually creates a registration-order bug. |
| EF Core persistence, repositories, unit of work, `Maybe<T>` queries, `[OwnedEntity]` | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-efcore.md`, `trellis-api-core.md`; add `trellis-api-mediator.md` when commits happen through handlers | EF owns mapping/interceptors; Mediator owns when command commits run. |
| FluentValidation integration | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-fluentvalidation.md`, `trellis-api-mediator.md` | FluentValidation plugs into `ValidationBehavior` through `IMessageValidator<TMessage>`; it is not a separate pipeline behavior. |
| Composition-root helpers (`AddTrellis`, `UseXxx`) | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-servicedefaults.md`, plus every package reference for selected modules | `TrellisServiceBuilder` preserves canonical order but does not register app-owned services like `DbContext` or Mediator handlers. |
| HTTP client adapters | `trellis-api-cookbook.md`, `trellis-api-http.md`, `trellis-api-core.md` | The HTTP package maps upstream responses into Core `Result<T>` / `Maybe<T>` shapes. |
| Tests | `trellis-api-testing-reference.md`; add `trellis-api-testing-aspnetcore.md` for `WebApplicationFactory` or `.http` replay | Unit/helper assertions and ASP integration helpers live in separate test packages. |
| Analyzer diagnostics | `trellis-api-anti-patterns.md` first for the canonical WRONG/FIX shape to adapt, then `trellis-api-analyzers.md`, then the package reference named by the diagnostic category | Anti-pattern file shows the canonical control-flow shape; analyzer docs explain the warning; the package reference gives the canonical API to use instead. |

Measurable completion check for generated code: every Trellis method call should be traceable to a loaded package reference, every selected integration module should be wired in the documented order, and every public API or behavior change should update the matching package reference plus this cookbook when it affects a cross-package recipe.

Known non-APIs and corrected assumptions:

| Do not write | Correct source-backed statement |
|---|---|
| `WithDocumentPerVersion()` | No Trellis API with this name exists. |
| `MapScalarApiReference()` | Sample-app helper only; not a Trellis framework API. |
| Place `UseScalarValueValidation()` anywhere | Add it before routing/endpoints that deserialize request bodies. |
| Mutate `IAuthorize.RequiredPermissions` | `RequiredPermissions` is an `IReadOnlyList<string>`. |
| `IValidate.Validate()` returns `Result` | The declared return type is `IResult`. |

### Mistake-regression routing

These rows route recurring LLM lab mistakes to the most relevant reference before code is written.

| If the task involves... | Read first | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Loading independent resources before creating a command result | [Recipe 21](#recipe-21--parallel-independent-loads-in-handlers-resultparallelasync--whenallasync) | Sequential awaits over genuinely independent loads (HTTP + DB, two upstream services) serialise latency. `Result.ParallelAsync(...).WhenAllAsync()` is the framework idiom. **Do NOT use against repositories sharing a scoped `DbContext`** — that races EF Core and throws; sequential is correct there. |
| Overdue/date-filter queries over `Maybe<DateTime>` | [Recipe 8](#recipe-8--ef-core-maybepropertymapping-for-nullable-value-objects), then [trellis-api-efcore.md](trellis-api-efcore.md#patterns-index) | Keep a typed specification and use `MaybeQueryableExtensions` in EF queries. |
| State transitions on an aggregate | [Recipe 9](#recipe-9--state-machine-canfire--fire-pattern-with-fireresult), then [trellis-api-statemachine.md](trellis-api-statemachine.md#patterns-index) | Keep transition methods consistent and put domain mutation after `FireResult` succeeds. |
| Cross-aggregate mutation such as cancel/return releasing stock | [Recipe 1](#recipe-1--crud-aggregate-ddd-value-objects--entity--repository-contract), [Recipe 2](#recipe-2--command--handler--fluentvalidation--ef-persistence), and [trellis-api-core.md](trellis-api-core.md#domain-driven-design) | The application handler orchestrates multiple aggregates; an aggregate mutates only itself. |
| Single-loop mutate-as-you-validate over a collection of related aggregates (reserve stock per line item, etc.) | [Recipe 25](#recipe-25--two-pass-validate-then-mutate-over-a-collection-of-related-aggregates) | A later element's validation failure leaves earlier elements partially mutated in memory. Validate every fallible domain check across every participating aggregate before the first state-changing call. |
| Result-returning ASP endpoints | [Recipe 4](#recipe-4--minimal-api-endpoint-wiring-resultt--httpresponseoptionsbuilder--tohttpresponse), [Recipe 5](#recipe-5--mvc-controller-using-asactionresult), then [trellis-api-asp.md](trellis-api-asp.md#patterns-index) | `AddTrellisAsp()` is required for Result-to-HTTP mapping; exception middleware is not the mapper. |
| Failure-code OpenAPI metadata or `.http` examples | [trellis-api-asp.md](trellis-api-asp.md#endpoint-checklist-for-generated-apis), [trellis-api-testing-aspnetcore.md](trellis-api-testing-aspnetcore.md#api-failure-path-test-checklist) | Generated APIs need failure paths, not happy-path-only docs/tests. |
| Resource authorization guards | [Recipe 7](#recipe-7--authorization-iactorprovider--iauthorize--resource-based-auth), then [trellis-api-authorization.md](trellis-api-authorization.md#patterns-index) | Use `Result.Ensure` for owner/admin boolean guards. |

## Recipe 1 — CRUD aggregate (DDD value objects + entity + repository contract)

**Problem.** Model an `Order` aggregate with a typed identifier, a value-object money type, and a repository contract that returns `Result<T>` for not-found.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Authorization;

// Strongly-typed ID: source-generated factory, equality, parsing, JSON converter.
public sealed partial class OrderId : RequiredGuid<OrderId>;

// Value object backed by a 3-letter ISO 4217 currency code.
[StringLength(3, MinimumLength = 3)]
public sealed partial class CurrencyCode : RequiredString<CurrencyCode>;

// Composite value object — must be a class (records can't inherit ValueObject).
public sealed class Money : ValueObject
{
    public Money(decimal amount, CurrencyCode currency) { Amount = amount; Currency = currency; }
    public decimal Amount { get; }
    public CurrencyCode Currency { get; }
    protected override IEnumerable<IComparable?> GetEqualityComponents()
    {
        yield return Amount;
        yield return Currency.Value;
    }
}

// Aggregate root.
public sealed class Order : Aggregate<OrderId>
{
    public Money Total { get; private set; } = default!;
    public OrderStatus Status { get; private set; }
    public ActorId OwnerId { get; private set; } = default!;

    private Order(OrderId id) : base(id) { }   // EF Core ctor

    // Idiomatic ROP factory: nullable parameters lift to Result<T> via T?.ToResult(error);
    // Combine aggregates per-field errors into a single Error.InvalidInput; Map's
    // tuple-deconstructing overload lets the lambda bind the validated non-null values
    // directly as id/total/ownerId.
    public static Result<Order> TryCreate(OrderId? id, Money? total, ActorId? ownerId) =>
        id.ToResult(Error.InvalidInput.ForField("id", "validation.error", "Order id is required."))
            .Combine(total.ToResult(Error.InvalidInput.ForField("total", "validation.error", "Total is required.")))
            .Combine(ownerId.ToResult(Error.InvalidInput.ForField("ownerId", "validation.error", "Owner id is required.")))
            .Map((id, total, ownerId) => new Order(id) { Total = total, Status = OrderStatus.Draft, OwnerId = ownerId });
}

// Trellis convention: model finite domain states as RequiredEnum<TSelf>
// (NOT C# enums). The partial keyword triggers the source generator.
public partial class OrderStatus : RequiredEnum<OrderStatus>
{
    public static readonly OrderStatus Draft     = new();
    public static readonly OrderStatus Submitted = new();
    public static readonly OrderStatus Cancelled = new();
}

// Repository contract — uses Maybe<T> for "may legitimately find nothing"
// Reserve Result<T> for failures the caller can act on.
public interface IOrderRepository
{
    Task<Maybe<Order>> FindAsync(OrderId id, CancellationToken ct);
    void Add(Order order);
}
```

**What it shows.** Each base class in this recipe supplies a complete surface — your derived type adds only domain-specific state. **Do not redeclare members that are already inherited**; that is the most common Recipe 1 mistake.

- `RequiredGuid<TSelf>` source-generates `TryCreate` overloads, `Parse`/`TryParse`, an explicit `Guid` → `TSelf` operator, the `Value` accessor, equality / `GetHashCode` / `IComparable`, JSON and EF Core converters, plus the `NewUniqueV4()` and `NewUniqueV7()` factories. Do not write your own `TryCreate`, equality members, parse/convert helpers, or JSON/EF converters.
- `RequiredString<TSelf>` source-generates `TryCreate(string?, string?)`, `Parse`/`TryParse`, an explicit `string` → `TSelf` operator, the `Value` accessor, equality, JSON and EF Core converters, plus `Length`/`StartsWith`/`Contains`/`EndsWith` pass-throughs. Same rule applies: derived classes add only domain-specific helpers (e.g., a custom `TryCreateWithValidation` that layers extra rules on top of the generated `TryCreate`).
- `ValueObject` (the base of `Money`, `Address`, etc.) supplies `Equals(object?)`, `Equals(ValueObject?)`, `GetHashCode`, `CompareTo`, and the `==`/`!=`/`<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=` operators — all derived from `GetEqualityComponents()`. Your derived type implements **only** `protected override IEnumerable<IComparable?> GetEqualityComponents()`. Do not override `Equals`/`GetHashCode`/`CompareTo` or write equality operators yourself — that breaks the contract the base class establishes. For `Maybe<T>` components, use the inherited `protected static IComparable? MaybeComponent<T>(Maybe<T>)` helper rather than unwrapping manually.
- `Aggregate<TId>` already supplies inherited infrastructure members: `Id`, protected `DomainEvents`, persistence-managed `ETag`, and `IsChanged` based on pending domain events. Do not redeclare those members on every aggregate; use the inherited surface and add only domain-specific state. Domain events are added via `DomainEvents.Add(...)` from inside the aggregate; the public read-only view is `IAggregate.UncommittedEvents()`.

> **Compiled contract.** The exact signatures of every member listed above are exercised in `Examples/CookbookSnippets/Recipe01_CrudAggregate.cs` → `Recipe1InheritedSurface`. That file is compiled in CI, so if a signature changes in the framework, the build fails and this callout MUST be updated to match. When you need to confirm an exact overload, read the demonstrator — never paraphrase signatures from memory.

`[StringLength]` and `[Range]` come from the **`Trellis` namespace** and are placed on the **class declaration** — using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` versions silently compiles but is ignored by the Trellis source generator (`TRLS017`).

**Anti-pattern → fix (TRLS017).**

```csharp
// WRONG — using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;     // ← wrong namespace
[StringLength(3, MinimumLength = 3)]             // TRLS017
public sealed partial class CurrencyCode : RequiredString<CurrencyCode>;

// FIX
using Trellis;                                   // ← Trellis attributes
[StringLength(3, MinimumLength = 3)]             // generator now picks it up
public sealed partial class CurrencyCode : RequiredString<CurrencyCode>;
```

---

## Recipe 2 — Command + handler + FluentValidation + EF persistence

**Problem.** Wire a `PlaceOrderCommand` end-to-end: validation via FluentValidation, mediator handler that uses an EF repository, transactional commit on success.

```csharp
using FluentValidation;
using Mediator;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp;
using Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Trellis.FluentValidation;
using Trellis.Mediator;
using Trellis.Primitives;

public sealed record PlaceOrderRequest(Guid OrderId, decimal Amount, string Currency, string OwnerId);

public sealed record PlaceOrderCommand(OrderId OrderId, Money Total, ActorId OwnerId)
    : ICommand<Result<OrderId>>
{
    public static Result<PlaceOrderCommand> TryCreate(PlaceOrderRequest request) =>
        Result.Combine(
                OrderId.TryCreate(request.OrderId, nameof(request.OrderId)),
                MonetaryAmount.TryCreate(request.Amount, nameof(request.Amount)),
                CurrencyCode.TryCreate(request.Currency, nameof(request.Currency)),
                ActorId.TryCreate(request.OwnerId, nameof(request.OwnerId)))
            .Map((orderId, amount, currency, ownerId) =>
                new PlaceOrderCommand(orderId, new Money(amount.Value, currency), ownerId));
}

public sealed class PlaceOrderValidator : AbstractValidator<PlaceOrderCommand>
{
    public PlaceOrderValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.Total.Amount)
            .LessThanOrEqualTo(10_000m)
            .WithMessage("Orders over 10,000 require manual approval.");
    }
}

public sealed class PlaceOrderHandler(IOrderRepository repo)
    : ICommandHandler<PlaceOrderCommand, Result<OrderId>>
{
    public ValueTask<Result<OrderId>> Handle(PlaceOrderCommand cmd, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        Order.TryCreate(cmd.OrderId, cmd.Total, cmd.OwnerId)
            .Tap(repo.Add)
            .Map(o => o.Id)
            .AsValueTask();
}

[ApiController]
[Route("orders")]
public sealed class OrdersController(ISender sender) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public ValueTask<ActionResult<OrderId>> Place([FromBody] PlaceOrderRequest request, CancellationToken ct) =>
        PlaceOrderCommand.TryCreate(request)
            .BindAsync(command => sender.Send(command, ct))
            .ToHttpResponseAsync()
            .AsActionResultAsync<OrderId>();
}

// Composition root
public static class OrdersDi
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddOrdersFeature(this IServiceCollection services) =>
        services
            .AddTrellisBehaviors()                              // Validation + logging + tracing
            .AddTrellisFluentValidation(typeof(PlaceOrderValidator).Assembly)
            .AddTrellisUnitOfWork<AppDbContext>()               // Innermost: commits on success
            .AddScoped<IOrderRepository, EfOrderRepository>();
}
```

**What it shows.** The mediator pipeline already runs `ValidationBehavior<TMessage, TResponse>` before the handler — `AddTrellisFluentValidation` plugs every `IValidator<T>` into it via the open-generic `IMessageValidator<T>` adapter. `AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>` registers `TransactionalCommandBehavior<,>` *after* the others, so it lands innermost and commits only when the handler returns success. The handler itself is pure: no `try`/`catch`, no primitive parsing, no `await db.SaveChangesAsync()` — that's the unit of work's job.

> **Multiple independent resources in the handler?** Reach for [Recipe 21](#recipe-21--parallel-independent-loads-in-handlers-resultparallelasync--whenallasync) when the loads hit *different* stores (HTTP + DB, two upstream services, factory-created `DbContext`s). For two repository reads against the same scoped `DbContext`, stay sequential — that case races EF Core. The Recipe explains the rule and shows both shapes.

> **Validation ownership.** Primitive→VO conversion happens at the transport seam. FluentValidation validates VO-shaped commands for cross-field rules and business invariants. Handlers receive value-object-shaped commands and must not parse primitives. See [Recipe 18](#recipe-18--dto-primitives-to-value-object-command-no-test-only-unwrap) for the canonical controller-seam adapter.

**Anti-pattern → fix (TRLS010).**

```csharp
// WRONG — sync-over-async (.Result deadlocks) + throwing inside the Result chain.
.Bind(id => repo.FindAsync(id, ct).Result is { HasValue: true }
    ? throw new InvalidOperationException("already exists")  // TRLS010 + TRLS005
    : Result.Ok(id))

// FIX — MatchAsync awaits the Maybe carrier and dispatches without leaving the Result chain.
.BindAsync(id => repo.FindAsync(id, ct)
    .MatchAsync(
        some: _  => Result.Fail<OrderId>(new Error.Conflict(ResourceRef.For<Order>(id), "already_exists")),
        none: () => Result.Ok(id)))
```

---

## Recipe 3 — Query handler returning `Page<T>` (paginated list with cursor)

**Problem.** Expose a list endpoint that paginates `Order` rows by cursor, exposes the requested vs. applied limit, and projects a DTO.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore;

// Paging cursor and limit are protocol/query-string controls validated at the transport seam.
public sealed record ListOrdersQuery(string? Cursor, int? Limit) : IQuery<Result<Page<OrderListItem>>>;

public sealed record OrderListItem(Guid Id, decimal Amount, string Currency);

public sealed class ListOrdersHandler(AppDbContext db)
    : IQueryHandler<ListOrdersQuery, Result<Page<OrderListItem>>>
{
    public async ValueTask<Result<Page<OrderListItem>>> Handle(ListOrdersQuery q, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var pageSize = PageSize.FromRequested(q.Limit);
        var cursor = q.Cursor is { Length: > 0 } token ? new Cursor(token) : (Cursor?)null;

        var page = await db.Orders.AsNoTracking()
            .ToPageAsync(pageSize, cursor, o => o.Id.Value, cursorFieldName: "cursor", ct);

        return page.Map(p => p.Map(o =>
            new OrderListItem(o.Id.Value, o.Total.Amount, o.Total.Currency.Value)));
    }
}
```

**What it shows.** `PageSize.FromRequested` is the canonical lenient parser: `null` or non-positive limits collapse to `PageSize.Default`, and `Applied` is clamped to `PageSize.Max` while `Requested` is preserved verbatim so `WasCapped` round-trips through the wire envelope. `IQueryable<T>.ToPageAsync` (from `Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore`) owns the `OrderBy`, the cursor decoding (returning `Error.InvalidInput` with `cursor.malformed` on a bad token), the seek `WHERE` predicate, the `Take(Applied + 1)` over-fetch, and the slice via `PageBuilder.FromOverFetch`. `Result<T>.Map` then composes the entity-to-DTO projection (via `Page<T>.Map`) without unwrapping the railway; `Previous` is always `null` (forward-only) until Trellis ships a reverse-seek API.

> **Cursor parsing must be ROP, not throwing.** `ToPageAsync` decodes cursors via `CursorCodec.TryDecode<TKey>` internally and returns `Result.Fail` on malformed input, so a bad cursor surfaces as a clean 422 rather than a 500. Hand-rolling `Guid.Parse(cursor)` would throw on malformed input and escape the handler as a 500.

## Recipe 4 — Minimal-API endpoint wiring `Result<T>` → `HttpResponseOptionsBuilder` → `ToHttpResponse`

**Problem.** Map a `Result<Order>` to a fully-conformant HTTP response: `200` with strong ETag and `Last-Modified`, `404`/`422` Problem Details on failure, `304` on `If-None-Match` match.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddTrellisAsp();          // error → status mapping + scalar-value validation
builder.Services.AddOrdersFeature();       // from Recipe 2

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/orders/{id:guid}", async (Guid id, IMediator mediator, CancellationToken ct) =>
{
    if (!OrderId.TryCreate(id, nameof(id)).TryGetValue(out var orderId, out var idError))
        return idError.ToHttpResponse();

    Result<Order> result = await mediator.Send(new GetOrderQuery(orderId), ct);

    return result.ToHttpResponse(opts => opts
        .WithETag(o => o.ETag)                         // strong ETag from aggregate
        .WithLastModified(o => o.LastModified)         // RFC 1123
        .Vary("Accept", "Accept-Language")
        .EvaluatePreconditions());                     // 304 / 412 handling
});

app.Run();
```

**What it shows.** `ToHttpResponse` returns `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResult` and is the **only** supported response verb. The fluent `HttpResponseOptionsBuilder<TDomain>` configures protocol semantics (`WithETag`, `WithLastModified`, `Vary`, `EvaluatePreconditions`) without leaking HTTP into the handler. Failures (`Error.NotFound`, `Error.InvalidInput`, …) round-trip through Problem Details using the `TrellisAspOptions` mapping registered by `AddTrellisAsp`.

---

## Recipe 5 — MVC controller using `AsActionResult`

**Problem.** Same payload as Recipe 4 but with a typed MVC `ActionResult<OrderDto>`.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp;

[ApiController]
[Route("orders")]
public sealed class OrdersController(IMediator mediator) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id:guid}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<OrderDto>> Get(Guid id, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        if (!OrderId.TryCreate(id, nameof(id)).TryGetValue(out var orderId, out var idError))
            return idError.ToHttpResponse().AsActionResult<OrderDto>();

        Result<Order> result = await mediator.Send(new GetOrderQuery(orderId), ct);

        return result
            .ToHttpResponse(
                body: o => new OrderDto(o.Id.Value, o.Total.Amount, o.Total.Currency.Value),
                configure: opts => opts.WithETag(o => o.ETag).EvaluatePreconditions())
            .AsActionResult<OrderDto>();
    }
}

public sealed record OrderDto(Guid Id, decimal Amount, string Currency);
```

**What it shows.** `.AsActionResult<TBody>()` projects an `IResult` into a typed `ActionResult<TBody>`, so MVC clients still get OpenAPI/Swagger-friendly typed responses while the response itself executes through the same `IResult` pipeline as Minimal API.

---

## Recipe 6 — Conditional GET with `EntityTagValue`

**Problem.** Serve a resource with strong-ETag conditional GET so clients can revalidate cheaply.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp;

app.MapGet("/blobs/{id:guid}", async (Guid id, IBlobRepository repo, CancellationToken ct) =>
{
    Result<BlobContent> result = await repo.FindAsync(new BlobId(id), ct);

    return result.ToHttpResponse(opts => opts
        .WithETag(b => EntityTagValue.Strong(b.Sha256Hex))
        .WithLastModified(b => b.UploadedAt)
        .EvaluatePreconditions());
});
```

**What it shows.** `EntityTagValue.Strong(...)` and `EntityTagValue.Weak(...)` build typed ETags; `WithETag` accepts either a `string` (always strong) or an `EntityTagValue`. `.EvaluatePreconditions()` honors `If-Match`/`If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since`/`If-Unmodified-Since` against the configured ETag and `Last-Modified` selectors, returning `304 Not Modified` or `412 Precondition Failed` as appropriate. For byte-range responses, call ASP.NET Core's `Results.File(stream, enableRangeProcessing: true)` directly — Trellis does not wrap that surface.

---

## Recipe 7 — Authorization: `IActorProvider` + `IAuthorize` + resource-based auth

**Problem.** Static (permission) authorization on a delete command, plus resource-based ownership check on an update command — all via the mediator pipeline.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp.Authorization;
using Trellis.Authorization;
using Trellis.Primitives;

public sealed record DeleteOrderCommand(OrderId OrderId) : ICommand<Result<Unit>>, IAuthorize
{
    public IReadOnlyList<string> RequiredPermissions => ["orders:delete"];
}

public sealed record UpdateOrderCommand(OrderId OrderId, Money NewTotal)
    : ICommand<Result<Unit>>, IAuthorizeResource<Order>, IIdentifyResource<Order, OrderId>
{
    // Typed VO carried straight through — no parse, no throw.
    // ASP.NET model binding (via IScalarValue<OrderId, string>) handles the
    // string→OrderId conversion at the API edge.
    public OrderId GetResourceId() => OrderId;

    public Trellis.IResult Authorize(Actor actor, Order resource) =>
        resource.OwnerId == actor.Id || actor.Permissions.Contains("orders:write")
            ? Result.Ok()
            : Result.Fail(new Error.Forbidden(PolicyId: "orders.owner", Resource: ResourceRef.For<Order>(OrderId)));
}

// DI wiring
services.AddTrellisBehaviors();
services.AddClaimsActorProvider();               // ClaimsActorProvider for ASP.NET Core
// Pass every assembly that contains command/query types AND every assembly that contains
// IResourceLoader<,> implementations. In a layered app the loader typically lives in the
// ACL assembly, not the Application assembly — passing only the Application assembly will
// register ResourceAuthorizationBehavior<,,> without discovering the shared loader and the
// pipeline will fail at runtime when it cannot resolve IResourceLoader<TMessage, TResource>.
// Note: the scanner does not de-duplicate assemblies; if the two layers happen to collapse
// to one assembly, pass it once (or .Distinct() the array) to avoid registering the behavior twice.
services.AddResourceAuthorization(
    typeof(UpdateOrderCommand).Assembly,        // Application assembly (commands + IAuthorizeResource)
    typeof(OrderResourceLoader).Assembly);      // ACL assembly (IResourceLoader<,> implementations)
```

**What it shows.** `IAuthorize` enforces an AND-permission gate via `AuthorizationBehavior<,>`. `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` runs *after* `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TResource>` produces the loaded resource, then calls `Authorize(actor, resource)`. Combining `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` with `IIdentifyResource<TResource, TId>` lets the framework reuse the shared `SharedResourceLoaderById<TResource, TId>` instead of requiring a per-command loader.

---

## Recipe 8 — EF Core: `MaybePropertyMapping` for nullable value objects

**Problem.** Persist a `Maybe<EmailAddress>` property with the EF Core `MaybeConvention`, then verify the generated mapping in a startup diagnostics check.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore;

public sealed partial class EmailAddress : RequiredString<EmailAddress>;

public sealed partial class Customer : Aggregate<CustomerId>
{
    public Customer(CustomerId id) : base(id) { }

    public partial Maybe<EmailAddress> Email { get; set; }   // TRLS035 if not 'partial'
}

// Configure
public sealed class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder) =>
        configurationBuilder.ApplyTrellisConventions(typeof(AppDbContext).Assembly);
}

// Diagnostics — print the generated storage members for every Maybe<T> in the model
public static class ModelDiagnostics
{
    public static void DumpMaybeMappings(DbContext db)
    {
        IReadOnlyList<MaybePropertyMapping> mappings = db.GetMaybePropertyMappings();
        foreach (var m in mappings)
            Console.WriteLine($"{m.EntityTypeName}.{m.PropertyName} → {m.MappedBackingFieldName} ({m.StoreType.Name})");
    }
}
```

**What it shows.** `Maybe<T>` properties are routed through `MaybeConvention`, which generates a backing field (`_email` for `Email`) that EF Core maps to a nullable column. The CLR property remains `Maybe<EmailAddress>` everywhere in the domain. `MaybePropertyMapping` is the diagnostic record that exposes both names — useful for `HasIndex` on the storage member.

> For **composite** value objects (multi-field `[OwnedEntity]` types like `ShippingAddress`) — and for `Maybe<T>` where `T` is composite — see [Recipe 13](#recipe-13--composite-value-object-end-to-end-domain--api-json-binding--ef-core-ownership). `Recipe 8` covers scalar `Maybe<T>` only.

**Anti-pattern → fix (TRLS016).**

```csharp
// WRONG — HasIndex against the CLR Maybe<T> property silently fails
modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().HasIndex(c => c.Email);   // TRLS016

// WRONG — explicit Property() configuration on a Maybe<T> CLR property.
// MaybeConvention generates a private backing field (e.g., _email) and maps THAT.
// Calling builder.Property(c => c.Email) tries to map Maybe<EmailAddress> as a column,
// which is not a supported store type — fails at model validation with
// "The property 'Customer.Email' could not be mapped because the database provider
//  does not support the type 'Maybe<EmailAddress>'."
internal sealed class CustomerConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Customer>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Customer> builder)
    {
        builder.Property(c => c.Email).IsRequired();          // ❌ — runtime error
        builder.Property(c => c.Email).HasMaxLength(254);     // ❌ — runtime error
    }
}

// FIX — say nothing about Maybe<T> in IEntityTypeConfiguration. The convention owns it.
// If you need column metadata (max length, column name, etc.), configure the *backing field*
// via the diagnostic name from MaybePropertyMapping, or use HasTrellisIndex for indexes.

// FIX 1 — strongly-typed Trellis index helper
modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().HasTrellisIndex(c => new { c.Status, c.Email });

// FIX 2 — string-based HasIndex against the storage member
modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().HasIndex("Status", "_email");
```

### Filtering on `Maybe<T>` properties in LINQ and `Specification<T>`

Once `MaybeConvention` maps the storage member, the **`MaybeQueryInterceptor`** (registered by `optionsBuilder.AddTrellisInterceptors()`) lets you write natural LINQ against the CLR `Maybe<T>` property — no `EF.Property<T?>(o, "_x")` boilerplate, no separate query helpers. The interceptor rewrites the expression tree before EF Core compiles it, translating `o.Maybe.HasValue`, `o.Maybe.Value`, `o.Maybe.GetValueOrDefault(d)`, `o.Maybe.HasValueWhere(t => ...)`, and `o.Maybe == Maybe<T>.None` to the storage-member access.

```csharp
// Specification — exactly the shape you'd write for an aggregate query.
public sealed class OverdueOrderSpecification(DateTime asOf) : Specification<Order>
{
    private readonly DateTime _threshold = asOf.AddDays(-7);

    // Natural multi-clause guard — analyzer-clean (TRLS003 recognises HasValue
    // anywhere in the connected `&&` subtree to the left of the `.Value` access),
    // safe in FakeRepository (HasValue short-circuits before Value), and translated
    // verbatim by MaybeQueryInterceptor in EF.
    public override Expression<Func<Order, bool>> ToExpression() =>
        o => o.Status == OrderStatus.Submitted
             && o.SubmittedAt.HasValue
             && o.SubmittedAt.Value < _threshold;
}

// Repository / DbContext usage — the spec composes through IQueryable.Where.
var overdue = await context.Orders
    .Where(new OverdueOrderSpecification(timeProvider.GetUtcNow().DateTime).ToExpression())
    .ToListAsync(ct);
```

**Why this works in both EF and `FakeRepository<T, TId>`** — the compiled `Func<Order, bool>` that `FakeRepository` evaluates in memory uses C#'s short-circuit `&&`, so `Value` is never read when `HasValue` is `false`. In EF, the interceptor rewrites both clauses to the mapped storage member and emits idiomatic SQL (`status = 'Submitted' AND submitted_at IS NOT NULL AND submitted_at < @threshold`). **One Specification, one predicate, identical semantics in production and in tests.**

**HasValueWhere shorthand.** The same parity holds when the two-clause guard is collapsed into `Maybe<T>.HasValueWhere(predicate)`. In-memory it expands to `HasValue && predicate(Value)` (predicate is never invoked on None); in EF the interceptor rewrites it to the same `IS NOT NULL AND ...` SQL. Use whichever form reads better — they are interchangeable.

```csharp
// Equivalent specification using HasValueWhere — same SQL, same FakeRepository semantics.
public override Expression<Func<Order, bool>> ToExpression() =>
    o => o.Status == OrderStatus.Submitted
         && o.SubmittedAt.HasValueWhere(t => t < _threshold);
```

**Sharing the spec with `FakeRepository`.** Pass the same `Specification<T>` instance through `QueryAsync` — never duplicate the predicate by hand in a fake adapter. Duplicating the predicate is the most expensive class of test bug to catch in code review (the fake passes while the real query silently returns the wrong rows).

```csharp
public Task<IReadOnlyList<Order>> FindOverdueAsync(DateTime asOf, CancellationToken ct) =>
    fake.QueryAsync(new OverdueOrderSpecification(asOf), ct);
```

> **Prerequisite.** The interceptor only runs when the `DbContext` is configured with `optionsBuilder.AddTrellisInterceptors()`. Without it, EF Core sees `Maybe<T>` as an unmapped CLR type and either drops the predicate silently or fails translation — while the `FakeRepository` tests continue to pass. This is the failure mode that creates "fake says yes, production says no". Always wire interceptors in `AddDbContext`.

```csharp
// Sentinel alternative — for predicates where you'd rather encode "absence acts as
// the most-permissive value" than carry the explicit HasValue clause. Reads as
// "if no SubmittedAt, treat as never overdue (DateTime.MaxValue)".
public override Expression<Func<Order, bool>> ToExpression() =>
    o => o.Status == OrderStatus.Submitted
         && o.SubmittedAt.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.MaxValue) < _threshold;
```

For ad-hoc `IQueryable<T>` calls (outside a `Specification<T>`), the strongly-typed `IQueryable<T>` extensions in `MaybeQueryableExtensions` — `WhereHasValue`, `WhereNone`, `WhereEquals`, `WhereLessThan`, `WhereGreaterThanOrEqual`, `OrderByMaybe`, etc. — are an alternative that doesn't depend on the interceptor. They compose with the same storage member directly via `EF.Property`.

```csharp
// Equivalent ad-hoc query without a Specification (interceptor not required for this form):
var overdue = await context.Orders
    .Where(o => o.Status == OrderStatus.Submitted)
    .WhereLessThan(o => o.SubmittedAt, threshold)
    .ToListAsync(ct);
```

---

## Recipe 9 — State machine: `CanFire` + `Fire` pattern with `FireResult`

**Problem.** Drive an order through `Draft → Submitted → Shipped` using Stateless, but expose every transition as `Result<TState>` so the mediator pipeline composes naturally.

```csharp
using Stateless;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.StateMachine;

// States and triggers as RequiredEnum value objects (Trellis convention) —
// equality is symbolic, so Stateless's TState/TTrigger generic constraints are satisfied.
public partial class DocumentState : RequiredEnum<DocumentState>
{
    public static readonly DocumentState Draft     = new();
    public static readonly DocumentState Submitted = new();
    public static readonly DocumentState Approved  = new();
}

public partial class DocumentTrigger : RequiredEnum<DocumentTrigger>
{
    public static readonly DocumentTrigger Submit  = new();
    public static readonly DocumentTrigger Approve = new();
    public static readonly DocumentTrigger Reject  = new();
}

public sealed class DocumentService
{
    public Result<DocumentState> Submit(Document doc)
    {
        var machine = new StateMachine<DocumentState, DocumentTrigger>(doc.State);
        machine.Configure(DocumentState.Draft).Permit(DocumentTrigger.Submit, DocumentState.Submitted);
        machine.Configure(DocumentState.Submitted)
               .Permit(DocumentTrigger.Approve, DocumentState.Approved)
               .Permit(DocumentTrigger.Reject,  DocumentState.Draft);

        // FireResult pre-checks CanFire and converts invalid transitions to an
        // Error.InvalidInput (HTTP 422) carrying a single RuleViolation with
        // ReasonCode "state.machine.invalid.transition" — invalid transitions are
        // semantic rule violations, not concurrent-modification conflicts.
        Result<DocumentState> result = machine.FireResult(DocumentTrigger.Submit);
        return result.Tap(newState => doc.State = newState);
    }
}
```

**What it shows.** `StateMachineExtensions.FireResult(...)` honors `PermitIf`/`IgnoreIf` guards via `CanFire(...)` rather than parsing exception messages, so it survives Stateless library upgrades. For aggregates whose state lives in a backing field (e.g., loaded from EF), use `LazyStateMachine<TState, TTrigger>` to defer machine creation until the first `FireResult` call.

**Side-effect placement.** Keep Stateless configuration declarative: states, triggers, permitted transitions, and pure/idempotent guards. Put business mutation, domain events, outbox writes, and other side effects after `FireResult` succeeds, usually in `.Tap(...)` as shown above. `FireResult` intentionally invokes `Fire(...)` even when `CanFire(...)` is false so any configured `OnUnhandledTrigger` callback can run. A custom unhandled-trigger callback may swallow the trigger, in which case `FireResult` returns `Result.Ok(stateMachine.State)` — the state read AFTER the callback runs (normally unchanged, but a callback that mutates or reroutes state will surface the resulting state). If side effects live in `OnEntry`, `OnExit`, transition callbacks, or `OnUnhandledTrigger`, they can run outside the visible ROP success/failure path and make handler behavior diverge from tests.

> **HTTP semantics.** Invalid state-machine transitions surface as `Error.InvalidInput` (HTTP 422), not `Error.Conflict` (HTTP 409). The reasoning: `Error.Conflict` semantically means "your request is valid but collides with concurrent state — retry may succeed"; a state-machine rejection ("you asked for `Submit` on a `Cancelled` order") is not retriable and is not about concurrent modification — it's a semantic rule violation. Callers that need to distinguish state-machine rejections from other 422s can match on the `RuleViolation.ReasonCode` value `state.machine.invalid.transition`.

```csharp
// Asserting on a state-machine rejection in tests:
var unproc = result.Error.Should().BeOfType<Error.InvalidInput>().Subject;
unproc.Rules.Should().ContainSingle().Which.ReasonCode.Should().Be("state.machine.invalid.transition");
```

---

## Recipe 10 — Test: handler test using `Trellis.Testing` `Should().Be(...)` / `UnwrapError()`

**Problem.** Unit-test the `PlaceOrderHandler` from Recipe 2 using FluentAssertions extensions from `Trellis.Testing`.

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Primitives;
using Trellis.Testing;
using Xunit;

public class PlaceOrderHandlerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task PlaceOrder_returns_id_on_success()
    {
        var repo = new InMemoryOrderRepository();
        var sut  = new PlaceOrderHandler(repo);

        var command = new PlaceOrderCommand(
            OrderId.TryCreate(Guid.NewGuid()).Unwrap(),
            Money.TryCreate(100m, "USD").Unwrap());

        var result = await sut.Handle(command, CancellationToken.None);

        result.Should().BeSuccess();
        result.Should().HaveValue(repo.Last().Id);                  // structural equality on Result<T>
    }

    [Fact]
    public void PlaceOrder_request_adapter_fails_when_currency_invalid()
    {
        var request = new PlaceOrderRequest(Guid.NewGuid(), 100m, "US"); // 2 chars, not 3

        var result = PlaceOrderCommand.TryCreate(request);

        result.Should().BeFailureOfType<Error.InvalidInput>()
            .Which.Should().HaveFieldError("currency");
    }
}
```

**What it shows.** `ResultAssertions<TValue>.HaveValue(...)` does structural comparison; `UnwrapError()` is the safe accessor that *only* returns the error and is intended for use after `Should().BeFailure...`. Calling `.Should()` on an `Error.InvalidInput` returns the specialized `ValidationErrorAssertions` (with `HaveFieldError`, `HaveFieldErrorWithDetail`, `HaveFieldCount`). Async assertions have two valid shapes: await the pipeline first and assert the resulting `Result<T>`, or call `BeSuccessAsync` / `BeFailureAsync` directly on `Task<Result<T>>` or `ValueTask<Result<T>>`. The unsupported shape is `await result.Should().BeSuccessAsync()` because `.Should()` returns synchronous `ResultAssertions<TValue>`.

---

## Recipe 11 — Anti-pattern → fix gallery (the analyzers in action)

The anti-pattern catalog moved to its own file so that AI sessions and human readers can load it independently when debugging an analyzer warning. See **[`trellis-api-anti-patterns.md`](trellis-api-anti-patterns.md)** for each common analyzer trigger and its idiomatic Trellis fix (TRLS001, TRLS003, TRLS010, TRLS016, TRLS017, TRLS018, TRLS019).

If you are looking up a specific analyzer by ID, the standalone file is faster than scanning this cookbook. The cookbook recipes still link to the relevant sections of that file where they apply.

---

## Recipe 12 — DI wiring playbook: `AddTrellis` composition builder

**Problem.** Compose Trellis service modules in the correct order so behaviors stack properly without forcing simple apps to install every package.

**Preferred: tiered builder.** Use `Trellis.ServiceDefaults` from the API/composition root. The builder records intent first, then applies modules in the canonical order. `UseEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork<TContext>()`, when selected, is always applied last so `TransactionalCommandBehavior<,>` lands innermost.

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Trellis.ServiceDefaults;

public static class CompositionRoot
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddApp(this IServiceCollection services, string connectionString)
    {
        // App-owned: provider, connection string, migrations, pooling, and Mediator registration.
        services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(opts => opts
            .UseSqlServer(connectionString)
            .AddTrellisInterceptors());

        services.AddMediator(options => options.Assemblies = [typeof(PlaceOrderCommand).Assembly]);

        services.AddTrellis(options => options
            .UseAsp()
            .UseMediator()
            .UseFluentValidation(typeof(PlaceOrderValidator).Assembly)
            .UseClaimsActorProvider()
            .UseResourceAuthorization(typeof(UpdateOrderCommand).Assembly)
            .UseEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork<AppDbContext>());

        services.AddScoped<IOrderRepository, EfOrderRepository>();

        return services;
    }
}
```

**Builder modules, summarized.**

| Module | What it applies | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- |
| `UseAsp()` | `AddTrellisAsp()` | Error → status mapping plus scalar-value JSON/model-binding validation. |
| `UseMediator()` | `AddTrellisBehaviors()` | Registers the canonical Result-aware pipeline behaviors. |
| `UseFluentValidation(...)` | `AddTrellisFluentValidation(...)` | Implies `UseMediator()`. Pass assemblies to scan, or omit assemblies when validators are registered explicitly. |
| `UseClaimsActorProvider()` / `UseEntraActorProvider()` / `UseDevelopmentActorProvider()` | One ASP actor provider | The builder rejects multiple actor providers. |
| `UseResourceAuthorization(...)` | `AddResourceAuthorization(...)` | Implies `UseMediator()` and scans for resource auth/loaders. |
| `UseEntityFrameworkUnitOfWork<TContext>()` | `AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>()` | Implies `UseMediator()` and is always applied last. |

**Still app-owned.** `AddTrellis(...)` does **not** call `AddDbContext`, `AddMediator`, or route-constraint registration. Those choices depend on provider, connection string, source-generator setup, migrations, route template names, and hosting style.

## Recipe 13 — Composite value object end-to-end (Domain + API JSON binding + EF Core ownership)

**Problem.** Persist a multi-field value object (`ShippingAddress` with street/city/state/postalCode/country) as part of a `Customer` aggregate. Every field is required, the VO must validate at construction, and the JSON wire format must reuse the same validation as the domain TryCreate.

The unobvious bits this recipe pins down:

- `ApplyTrellisConventions` already configures composite value objects as owned navigations — **you do not need `builder.OwnsOne(...)` in your `IEntityTypeConfiguration`** (the `CompositeValueObjectConvention` discovers them by **inheritance from `ValueObject`** when the assembly is passed to `ApplyTrellisConventions`). The `[OwnedEntity]` attribute is **not** the convention's discovery key — it drives the source generator (which emits the parameterless ctor EF Core's materializer needs) and the analyzers `TRLS036` / `TRLS037` / `TRLS038`. The convention will Owned-map any `ValueObject` subtype in the scanned assemblies; without `[OwnedEntity]` the generator does not emit the parameterless ctor and materialization fails at runtime — `[OwnedEntity]` is therefore required in practice even though the convention doesn't read it directly.
- The class **must** be `partial` (`TRLS036`), inherit `ValueObject` (`TRLS038`), and have **no** parameterless constructor (`TRLS037`) — the source generator emits one for EF Core's materialization path.
- `[JsonConverter(typeof(CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<TSelf>))]` routes JSON deserialization through the public `TryCreate`, so the API surface and the domain agree on what's valid. Without it, model binding produces a default-constructed VO that bypasses `TryCreate`.

```csharp
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Trellis.Primitives;

[OwnedEntity]                                                        // TRLS036 if not partial; TRLS037 if you add a parameterless ctor; TRLS038 if not ValueObject
[JsonConverter(typeof(CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<ShippingAddress>))]
public partial class ShippingAddress : ValueObject
{
    public string Street     { get; private set; } = null!;
    public string City       { get; private set; } = null!;
    public string State      { get; private set; } = null!;
    public string PostalCode { get; private set; } = null!;
    public string Country    { get; private set; } = null!;

    private ShippingAddress(string street, string city, string state, string postalCode, string country)
    {
        Street = street; City = city; State = state; PostalCode = postalCode; Country = country;
    }

    public static Result<ShippingAddress> TryCreate(
        string street, string city, string state, string postalCode, string country, string? fieldName = null)
    {
        var violations = new List<FieldViolation>(5);
        AddIfBlank(violations, street,     fieldName, nameof(Street));
        AddIfBlank(violations, city,       fieldName, nameof(City));
        AddIfBlank(violations, state,      fieldName, nameof(State));
        AddIfBlank(violations, postalCode, fieldName, nameof(PostalCode));
        AddIfBlank(violations, country,    fieldName, nameof(Country));
        return violations.Count > 0
            ? Result.Fail<ShippingAddress>(new Error.InvalidInput(EquatableArray.Create(violations.ToArray())))
            : Result.Ok(new ShippingAddress(street.Trim(), city.Trim(), state.Trim(), postalCode.Trim(), country.Trim()));

```

**What it shows.**

- `[OwnedEntity]` + `partial` + `ValueObject` + private ctor is the contract. The three diagnostics (`TRLS036`/`037`/`038`) catch each violation at compile time.
- `CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<T>` makes JSON deserialization round-trip through `TryCreate`, so an API request body with a missing `state` produces the same `Error.InvalidInput` shape the domain emits.
- `ApplyTrellisConventions` removes the boilerplate `OwnsOne` call. You only need `OwnsOne` when you want to **override** the convention (custom column names, table splitting, indexes on inner properties).

**Storage shape.**

| Aggregate property | Storage |
|---|---|
| Required `ShippingAddress` (non-nullable) | Table-split: 5 columns on the `Customers` table — `ShippingAddress_Street`, `ShippingAddress_City`, `ShippingAddress_State`, `ShippingAddress_PostalCode`, `ShippingAddress_Country` (all `NOT NULL`). |
| Optional `Maybe<ShippingAddress>` | Because the inner properties are non-nullable, `CompositeValueObjectConvention` switches to a **separate table** named `{Owner}_{Property}` (e.g., `Customer_BillingAddress`) with a `1:0..1` FK back to `Customers`. See the storage rules in [trellis-api-efcore.md](trellis-api-efcore.md) for the full decision matrix. |

**JSON wire shape.**

The `[JsonConverter(typeof(CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<T>))]` attribute on the value object controls the wire format. There is no auto-discovery — the attribute is required for the converter to engage on request bodies and response payloads.

| C# property | JSON request/response shape |
|---|---|
| `ShippingAddress ShippingAddress { get; private set; }` (required composite VO) | `"shippingAddress": { "street": "1 Main St", "city": "Redmond", "state": "WA", "postalCode": "98052", "country": "US" }` — every field present; missing inner field → `Error.InvalidInput` with field path `/shippingAddress/<field>`. |
| `partial Maybe<ShippingAddress> BillingAddress { get; set; }` (optional composite VO on a domain model — **not** used directly on a request DTO; see Recipe 14) | Domain model only. On the wire, request DTOs use a **nullable transport** (`ShippingAddress?`) and the controller adapts via `Maybe.From(...)`. Response DTOs project to `ShippingAddress?` for the same reason. |
| `Money Total { get; private set; }` (required composite VO with scalar inner properties — `decimal Amount`, `Currency Currency`) | `"total": { "amount": 49.99, "currency": "USD" }` — the property casing comes from System.Text.Json's `PropertyNamingPolicy.CamelCase` (set by `AddTrellisAsp()`). Inner scalar VOs (e.g., `Currency : RequiredString<Currency>`) serialize as their underlying primitive (`"USD"`, not `{"value":"USD"}`). |
| Scalar VO (`OrderId : RequiredGuid<OrderId>`, `EmailAddress : RequiredString<EmailAddress>`) | Always serializes as the underlying primitive (`"550e8400-..."`, `"a@b.com"`). Never wrapped in `{ "value": ... }`. This is automatic via the source-generated `IScalarValue<T,P>` JSON converter. |

**Anti-pattern → fix.**

```csharp
// WRONG — explicit Property() on a composite owned VO. The convention has already
// registered an OwnsOne relationship; calling builder.Property() tries to map the
// composite as a single column, which fails at model validation with
// "The property 'Order.Total' could not be mapped because the database provider
//  does not support the type 'Money'."
internal sealed class OrderConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Order>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> builder)
    {
        builder.Property(o => o.Total).IsRequired();           // ❌ — runtime error
        builder.Property(o => o.ShippingAddress).IsRequired(); // ❌ — runtime error
    }
}

// FIX — say nothing about composite owned VOs in IEntityTypeConfiguration. The convention
// auto-registers them as OwnsOne. To override (rename column, add an index on an inner
// property, force table-splitting), use OwnsOne explicitly — it is additive, not duplicative,
// because the convention checks IsOwned() before re-registering.

// WRONG — manual OwnsOne after ApplyTrellisConventions duplicates the convention's work
// and silently overrides any annotations the convention set.
builder.OwnsOne(c => c.ShippingAddress, owned => { /* … */ });

// FIX — let the convention own the registration. Use OwnsOne only to override
// (e.g., to rename columns or add an index on an inner property):
builder.OwnsOne(c => c.ShippingAddress, owned =>
{
    owned.Property(a => a.PostalCode).HasColumnName("PostalCode").HasMaxLength(20);
    owned.HasIndex(a => a.Country);
});
```

```csharp
// WRONG — non-partial class (TRLS036) so the generator can't emit the parameterless ctor.
[OwnedEntity]
public class ShippingAddress : ValueObject { /* … */ }

// WRONG — declared parameterless ctor (TRLS037) shadows the generator's emitted one.
[OwnedEntity]
public partial class ShippingAddress : ValueObject { public ShippingAddress() { } }

// WRONG — not a ValueObject (TRLS038), so equality and convention-based mapping break.
[OwnedEntity]
public partial class ShippingAddress { /* … */ }
```

### Owned collections with a private backing field

When an aggregate exposes a collection navigation as an `IReadOnlyList<T>` (or `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`) facade over a private `List<T>` field, **ignore the facade and map via the backing field name**. EF Core cannot instantiate an interface type for a navigation, so it has to bind directly to the concrete `List<T>` field.

```csharp
public sealed partial class Order : Aggregate<OrderId>
{
    private readonly List<LineItem> _lineItems = [];
    public IReadOnlyList<LineItem> LineItems => _lineItems;       // public facade — interface, EF can't materialize
    // ...
}

internal sealed class OrderConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Order>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> builder)
    {
        builder.HasKey(o => o.Id);

        // The public facade is IReadOnlyList<T> — EF cannot instantiate an interface.
        // Ignore the facade and map directly against the private backing field by name.
        builder.Ignore(o => o.LineItems);
        builder.OwnsMany<LineItem>("_lineItems", li =>
        {
            li.ToTable("LineItems");
            li.HasKey(x => x.Id);
            // Inner composite VO properties (e.g., LineItem.UnitPrice : Money) are
            // discovered by EF Core's NavigationDiscoveryConvention because
            // CompositeValueObjectConvention registers each composite VO type as Owned
            // globally at model initialization — no extra OwnsOne needed here.
        });
    }
}
```

The string `"_lineItems"` is unfortunately part of the public mapping contract: rename the private field and the EF model silently stops working. Two mitigations and what they buy you:

| Mitigation | Compile-time safety | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Raw string `"_lineItems"` | None — typo or rename breaks at runtime model-validation. | Zero. The pattern shown above. |
| `private const string LineItemsField = "_lineItems";` on `Order`, then `builder.OwnsMany<LineItem>(Order.LineItemsField, …)` | Refactoring tools follow the constant. Still no compile check that the field actually exists. | Leaks the field name through `internal`/`public` constant on the aggregate — adds public surface for a persistence concern. |
| `builder.OwnsMany(o => o.LineItems, …)` directly against the facade | n/a | Does not work: EF reports it cannot determine the relationship from `IReadOnlyList<LineItem>`. |

**Why no `[OwnedEntity]`-style convention for collections (yet).** `CompositeValueObjectConvention` discovers composite owned *value objects* by inheritance from `ValueObject`. An equivalent collection convention would need to walk every aggregate, find `IReadOnlyList<T>` / `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` properties whose `T` is an entity, locate a matching `_camelCase` backing field, and register the `OwnsMany` against it. This is on the roadmap (tracked as the analogue of `MaybeConvention` for collections); for now the cookbook pattern above is the supported approach.

### Supported property shapes inside a composite VO — when to map to a DTO instead

`CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<T>` is deliberately small. It supports a closed list of primitive types directly and routes Trellis scalar value objects through their underlying primitives. Anything else — including any `Maybe<T>`, arrays, collections, and nested composite VO properties — throws `TrellisJsonValidationException` at the first JSON access. The converter never delegates property reads/writes back to `JsonSerializer`, so adding `[JsonConverter]` to an inner composite type does not rescue the nested case. **EF Core persistence is more permissive** (`Maybe<T>`, arrays, and nested composites work) so the JSON gap only surfaces when the composite VO crosses an HTTP boundary.

The intentional split is: keep the framework converter simple; route consumers with richer shapes through a wire-shape DTO at the controller/endpoint seam (Recipe 14 generalised).

| Property type on a composite VO interior | JSON via `CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter`? | Recommended path |
|---|---|---|
| `string` | ✅ Supported as-is | Use directly. |
| `decimal`, `int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`, `double`, `float`, `bool` | ✅ Supported as-is | Use directly. |
| `Guid`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset` | ✅ Supported as-is | Use directly. |
| Trellis scalar VO (`RequiredString<>`, `RequiredInt<>`, `RequiredGuid<>`, `RequiredEnum<>`, `RequiredDateTime<>`, …) — and shipped concretes like `EmailAddress`, `PhoneNumber`, `Money.Currency` | ✅ Flattens to underlying primitive on the wire | Use directly. The composite converter detects `IScalarValue<,>` and reads/writes the inner primitive. |
| **Nullable** Trellis scalar VO (`PropertyType? Optional` declared as a property on the composite VO) | ⚠️ **Write/read asymmetric.** Writing `null` produces JSON `null`; reading the same JSON throws a primitive-specific validation error (e.g. `Property '...' must be a string.` for a string-backed scalar like `RequiredString<>` / `RequiredEnum<>`; `must be an integer.` for `RequiredInt<>`; `must be a GUID.` for `RequiredGuid<>`). The converter doesn't propagate TryCreate parameter nullability through its metadata, so `ReadPrimitive` cannot distinguish a required scalar from a nullable scalar interior. | **Map to a DTO.** Same pattern as `Maybe<T>` below — declare the optional field on the wire-shape DTO as nullable, lift to `Maybe<TScalar>` (preferred) or keep nullable on the domain VO and resolve at the seam. The asymmetry is pinned by `CompositeVoBoundaryTests.Nullable_scalar_VO_interior_is_write_read_asymmetric_for_null_value`. |
| Nested composite owned VO (e.g., a nested `Money` or `ShippingAddress` as a property of another composite VO) | ❌ **Not supported.** `CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<TOuter>` does not delegate to `JsonSerializer` for property values — it only reads/writes its own primitive allowed list directly. Adding `[JsonConverter]` to the inner type does not help, because the outer converter never asks STJ for an inner converter; it tries to treat the nested type as one of its primitives and trips on the first access. | **Map to a DTO** — declare each nested composite as its own property on the wire-shape DTO. Nested composite VOs serialize correctly only when STJ sees them at the top of a property of a non-Trellis-composite-converter type (i.e., a plain record/class with `[JsonConverter]` on the nested VO type itself). |
| `Maybe<T>` for any T (primitive, scalar VO, composite VO, array) | ❌ **Not supported.** Throws `TrellisJsonValidationException: "Unsupported primitive type 'Maybe`1...'"` regardless of value (`Some` or `None`). | **Map to a wire-shape DTO.** See Recipe 14 — the same `T?` + adapt-at-the-seam pattern applies whether the optional is on the DTO itself or inside a composite VO. |
| Array (`T[]`), collection (`List<T>`, `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IEnumerable<T>`) | ❌ Not supported. | **Map to a DTO** with the array on the wire-shape type. |

**When to use a DTO at the seam (the general rule).** If a composite VO's interior holds any property shape outside the supported list — most commonly `Maybe<TPrimitive>` or arrays — keep the VO clean as a domain type and declare a wire-shape DTO at the controller/endpoint:

```csharp
// Domain VO: clean, persists fine via EF Core, but cannot serialize as-is.
[OwnedEntity]
public partial class CustomerProfile : ValueObject
{
    public OrderStatus Status { get; private set; } = null!;
    public partial Maybe<int> AgeYears { get; private set; }             // not JSON-serializable on this VO
    public partial Maybe<string> Nickname { get; private set; }          // not JSON-serializable
    public partial Maybe<DateTime[]> LoginHistory { get; private set; }  // not JSON-serializable
    // ...TryCreate, GetEqualityComponents...
}

// Wire-shape DTO at the API seam: everything as nullable transports the converter can serialize.
public sealed record CustomerProfileDto(string Status, int? AgeYears, string? Nickname, DateTime[]? LoginHistory)
{
    public Result<CustomerProfile> ToDomain() =>
        CustomerProfile.TryCreate(
            Status,
            AgeYears.AsMaybe(),
            Nickname is null ? Maybe<string>.None : Maybe.From(Nickname),
            LoginHistory is null ? Maybe<DateTime[]>.None : Maybe.From(LoginHistory));

    public static CustomerProfileDto From(CustomerProfile vo) =>
        new(vo.Status.Value,
            vo.AgeYears.AsNullable(),
            vo.Nickname.HasValue ? vo.Nickname.Value : null,
            vo.LoginHistory.HasValue ? vo.LoginHistory.Value : null);
}
```

The controller takes `CustomerProfileDto` on inbound requests, calls `.ToDomain()` to lift to the domain VO, and projects back via `CustomerProfileDto.From(...)` on responses. The Trellis scalar `Maybe<>` extensions (`AsMaybe` / `AsNullable`) and `Maybe.From` handle the lift cleanly.

**Last-resort escape hatch — write your own `JsonConverter<TComposite>`.** If a service genuinely cannot tolerate the DTO indirection (rare — usually a sign the design wants tightening), the language's standard mechanism still applies: declare `[JsonConverter(typeof(YourCustomConverter))]` on the composite VO and implement `Read`/`Write` directly. The framework does not provide help for this path; the trade-off is more code per-VO in exchange for putting the domain shape directly on the wire. This is not the recommended path — favour the DTO seam unless there is a concrete reason not to.

## Recipe 14 — Optional fields in request DTOs: `Maybe<TScalar>` vs nullable transport

**Problem.** A request body has an optional field — say `phoneNumber` on `CreateCustomerRequest`. The domain models it as `Maybe<PhoneNumber>` (the canonical Trellis pattern). What does the DTO declare it as?

The answer depends on whether the inner type is a **scalar** (single-primitive) value object or a **composite** owned value object. Trellis ships a JSON converter + model binder for the scalar case but not the composite case.

| Inner type | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Maybe<TScalar>` where `TScalar : IScalarValue<TScalar, TPrimitive>` (e.g., `Maybe<EmailAddress>`, `Maybe<PhoneNumber>`) | **Use `Maybe<T>` directly on the DTO.** | `AddTrellisAsp()` registers `MaybeScalarValueJsonConverterFactory` (JSON) and `MaybeModelBinder<T,P>` (route/query/header); MVC child-validation suppression for `None` scalar-maybe values is handled internally by the Trellis MVC integration. Call `AddTrellisAsp(...)` before MVC model binding is configured. `null`/missing → `None`; valid → `Maybe.From(validated)`; invalid → ProblemDetails with the same field path the domain emits. |
| `Maybe<TComposite>` where `TComposite : ValueObject` with multiple fields (e.g., `Maybe<ShippingAddress>`) | **Use a nullable transport (`TComposite?`) and adapt at the controller seam.** | No `MaybeCompositeValueObjectJsonConverterFactory` ships today — System.Text.Json would default-construct the inner type, bypassing `TryCreate`. Wrap with `Maybe.From(...)` inside the controller. |
| `Maybe<TPrimitive>` (e.g., `Maybe<int>`, `Maybe<long>`, `Maybe<string>`, `Maybe<Guid>`, `Maybe<DateTime>`) | **Use `Maybe<T>` directly on the DTO.** | `AddTrellisAsp()` registers `MaybePrimitiveJsonConverterFactory` (JSON) and `MaybePrimitiveModelBinder<T>` (route/query/header). Same closed-primitive allowed list as `CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter` (`string`, `decimal`, `int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`, `double`, `float`, `bool`, `Guid`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`). `null`/missing → `None`; valid primitive → `Maybe.From(value)`. If the primitive carries domain meaning, you may still prefer wrapping it in a scalar value object (e.g., `Age : RequiredInt<Age>`) for the wire-time validation `TryCreate` provides; both shapes are factory-handled. |
| `Maybe<TUnsupportedPrimitive>` (e.g., `Maybe<DateOnly>`, `Maybe<TimeOnly>`, `Maybe<uint>`) | **Use `TUnsupportedPrimitive?` on the DTO and `.AsMaybe()` at the seam.** | These types are outside both the composite-VO converter allowed list and the `Maybe<TPrimitive>` factory allowed list. The wire-shape DTO + adapter at the controller seam is the same pattern as `Maybe<TComposite>`. |

> **The same DTO pattern applies inside a composite VO.** If a *composite value object's interior* contains `Maybe<TPrimitive>` / arrays / collections, `CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter` rejects them too (see Recipe 13 §"Supported property shapes inside a composite VO"). Keep the composite VO clean as a domain type and declare a wire-shape DTO with nullable transports, then lift on inbound (`.AsMaybe()` / `Maybe.From(...)`) and project on outbound (`.AsNullable()`).

### Pattern A — scalar `Maybe<T>` directly on the DTO

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Primitives;

public sealed partial class EmailAddress : RequiredString<EmailAddress>;
public sealed partial class PhoneNumber  : RequiredString<PhoneNumber>;

public sealed record CreateCustomerRequest(
    EmailAddress         Email,           // required
    Maybe<PhoneNumber>   PhoneNumber);    // optional — null/missing JSON → Maybe.None

[ApiController]
[Route("customers")]
public sealed class CustomersController(ISender sender) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public ValueTask<ActionResult<CustomerResponse>> Create(
        [FromBody] CreateCustomerRequest request, CancellationToken ct) =>
        sender.Send(new CreateCustomerCommand(request.Email, request.PhoneNumber), ct)
              .ToHttpResponseAsync(CustomerResponse.From, /* … */)
              .AsActionResultAsync<CustomerResponse>();
}
```

`AddTrellisAsp()` is the only wiring required:

```csharp
services.AddTrellisAsp();      // MaybeScalarValueJsonConverterFactory + MaybePrimitiveJsonConverterFactory + MaybeModelBinder + MaybePrimitiveModelBinder + ValidationVisitor patch
services.AddControllers();
```

Send `{"email":"a@b.com","phoneNumber":null}` (or omit `phoneNumber` entirely) → handler receives `Maybe<PhoneNumber>.None`. Send `{"email":"a@b.com","phoneNumber":"not a phone"}` → 422 with field path `/phoneNumber` and the validation message produced by `PhoneNumber.TryCreate`.

### Pattern B — composite owned VO, nullable transport + controller-seam adapter

```csharp
public sealed record CreateCustomerRequest(
    EmailAddress       Email,
    ShippingAddress?   ShippingAddress);   // nullable transport — NOT Maybe<ShippingAddress>

public sealed class CustomersController(ISender sender) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public ValueTask<ActionResult<CustomerResponse>> Create(
        [FromBody] CreateCustomerRequest request, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var shipping = request.ShippingAddress is null
            ? Maybe<ShippingAddress>.None
            : Maybe.From(request.ShippingAddress);

        return sender.Send(new CreateCustomerCommand(request.Email, shipping), ct)
                     .ToHttpResponseAsync(CustomerResponse.From, /* … */)
                     .AsActionResultAsync<CustomerResponse>();
    }
}
```

The composite VO must still carry `[JsonConverter(typeof(CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<ShippingAddress>))]` (see Recipe 13) so its inner fields round-trip through `TryCreate`. The seam adapter only handles the optionality.

**Why not just declare `Maybe<ShippingAddress>` on the DTO?** `MaybeScalarValueJsonConverterFactory.CanConvert` checks for `IScalarValue<,>` on the inner type. Composite VOs do not implement `IScalarValue`, so the factory returns false, and `Maybe<ShippingAddress>` falls back to default System.Text.Json serialization — which produces a default-constructed `ShippingAddress` (`{}`) wrapped in `Maybe.From`, silently bypassing `TryCreate`. That's a correctness bug, not just an ergonomics one. **`TRLS020` enforces this rule at compile time**: any DTO property typed `Maybe<TComposite>` where `TComposite` is `[OwnedEntity]` is flagged as a warning, even when `TComposite` itself carries `[JsonConverter(typeof(CompositeValueObjectJsonConverter<TComposite>))]` — the converter operates on `TComposite`, not on `Maybe<TComposite>`, so the inner attribute does not rescue the wrapper shape.

### Anti-pattern → fix

```csharp
// WRONG — composite Maybe<T> on DTO. Compiles, deserializes to Maybe.From(default(ShippingAddress)),
// silently skips TryCreate. Discovered only when the persisted entity has empty strings.
public sealed record CreateCustomerRequest(EmailAddress Email, Maybe<ShippingAddress> ShippingAddress);

// FIX — nullable transport + controller-seam adapter (Pattern B above).
public sealed record CreateCustomerRequest(EmailAddress Email, ShippingAddress? ShippingAddress);

// WRONG — bypassing AddTrellisAsp() (e.g., raw services.AddControllers().AddJsonOptions(...) in isolation)
// drops the Maybe converters AND the SuppressChildValidationMetadataProvider, so MVC's ValidationVisitor
// will throw InvalidOperationException("Maybe has no value.") the moment a None reaches model validation.
services.AddControllers();   // missing AddTrellisAsp()

// FIX — call AddTrellisAsp() before AddControllers(); it is idempotent and configures both pipelines.
services.AddTrellisAsp();
services.AddControllers();
```

> A future `MaybeCompositeValueObjectJsonConverterFactory` could make Pattern B unnecessary; until then, nullable transport plus controller-seam adaptation is the supported pattern.

## Recipe 15 — *(retired)*

This recipe previously documented a `GetValueOrDefault(SENTINEL)` workaround for a `TRLS003` false positive on multi-clause `Maybe<T>` predicates inside `Specification<T>.ToExpression()`. The false positive was fixed in the analyzer (`UnsafeMaybeValueAccess` now recognises the multi-clause guard), so the natural shape

```csharp
o => o.Status == OrderStatus.Submitted
     && o.SubmittedAt.HasValue
     && o.SubmittedAt.Value < _threshold;
```

is now both readable AND analyzer-clean inside any expression tree (specifications, FluentValidation, EF). The residual EF-Core/`FakeRepository` parity guidance — `AddTrellisInterceptors()`, `ApplyTrellisConventions`, and "share the same `Specification<T>` between EF and `FakeRepository` — never duplicate the predicate" — has moved into [Recipe 8](#recipe-8--ef-core-maybepropertymapping-for-nullable-value-objects). Ad-hoc query operators (`WhereLessThan`, `WhereHasValue`, etc.) live in [trellis-api-efcore.md](trellis-api-efcore.md).

The recipe number is preserved as a stub so existing bookmark and search-index entries remain stable; future content should renumber from Recipe 24 rather than reusing 15.

## Recipe 16 — Unit of work in handlers: `Add` staging vs immediate `SaveAsync`

**Problem.** A command handler creates a new aggregate. Where does the `SaveChanges` call go? The first time you read a Trellis handler that ends with `repo.Add(order); return Result.Ok(order.Id);` the question is unavoidable: *who actually saves it?*

```csharp
public sealed class CreateOrderHandler(IOrderRepository repo)
    : ICommandHandler<CreateOrderCommand, Result<OrderId>>
{
    public ValueTask<Result<OrderId>> Handle(CreateOrderCommand cmd, CancellationToken ct) =>
        Order.TryCreate(cmd.Total)
            .Tap(repo.Add)                  // stages — no save here
            .Map(o => o.Id)
            .AsValueTask();                 // handler returns immediately
}
```

> `repo.Add(entity)` stages the aggregate for insertion via EF Core; `TransactionalCommandBehavior`, registered by `services.AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>()` in your ACL composition root, automatically calls `SaveChangesAsync` after every successful handler — no explicit save call is needed in the handler.

**What it shows.** Handlers in Trellis follow a strict separation: the handler shapes domain state and the pipeline owns the commit boundary. `IRepository.Add` returns `void` precisely to signal "staged, not yet persisted" — the `void` return makes it impossible to write the (wrong) `await repo.Add(...).Should().BeSuccess()`. The mediator pipeline for command handlers is, innermost first: `TransactionalCommandBehavior` → `ValidationBehavior` → `LoggingBehavior` → handler. When the handler returns a successful `Result<T>`, the transactional behavior calls `SaveChangesAsync` and only then surfaces the result; on failure or exception, nothing is committed.

| Method | Signature | Saves immediately? | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IRepository.Add(T)` (and `Remove(T)`, `RemoveByIdAsync(TId)`) | `void` / `Task<Result<Unit>>` for not-found | **No** — staged for the UoW | Handlers and any production-shaped repository contract |
| `FakeRepository.Add(T)` | `void` | n/a (in-memory; visible immediately) | **Test setup** — "put this in the store so the handler can find it" |
| `FakeRepository.SaveAsync(T)` | `Task<Result<Unit>>` | n/a (in-memory; visible immediately) | Tests that explicitly assert on the `Result` shape, e.g., conflict-result handling |

**Anti-pattern → fix.**

```csharp
// ❌ Wrong — explicit SaveChangesAsync in the handler. Bypasses TransactionalCommandBehavior,
//   so cross-aggregate behaviors that depend on a single commit boundary (outbox writes,
//   ETag bumps, audit logs) end up in inconsistent states. Also: you've now committed even
//   if a later behavior in the pipeline fails post-handler.
public ValueTask<Result<OrderId>> Handle(CreateOrderCommand cmd, CancellationToken ct) =>
    Order.TryCreate(cmd.Total)
        .Tap(repo.Add)
        .TapAsync(_ => dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(ct));   // ❌ — duplicates UoW, racy

// ❌ Wrong — calling SaveAsync from a production handler. SaveAsync is a FakeRepository
//   convenience for tests. EF repositories don't expose it (and shouldn't).
.TapAsync(o => repo.SaveAsync(o, ct))   // ❌ — IRepository<Order>.SaveAsync doesn't exist

// ✅ Correct — stage with Add, let TransactionalCommandBehavior commit on success.
.Tap(repo.Add)
```

**Test setup pattern.** When unit-testing a handler with `FakeRepository`, prefer `Add` for setup and reserve `SaveAsync` for tests that specifically assert on the Result of the save (conflict handling, etc.). The void surface keeps the test intent visually honest: setup should not have a return value to assert on.

```csharp
// ✅ Setup: void Add — no .GetAwaiter().GetResult(), no Result assertion in setup.
var customers = new FakeRepository<Customer, CustomerId>();
customers.Add(MakeAlice());   // helper builds a valid Customer via Customer.TryCreate(...)

// ✅ Conflict-result test: SaveAsync returns the Error.Conflict so the test can assert.
var customers = new FakeRepository<Customer, CustomerId>().WithUniqueConstraint(c => c.Email);
customers.Add(MakeAlice());                                          // first alice — accepted
var result = await customers.SaveAsync(MakeAlice());                 // intentional conflict
result.UnwrapError().Should().BeOfType<Error.Conflict>();
```

> `FakeRepository.Add` enforces unique constraints **eagerly** by throwing `InvalidOperationException` — setup-time violations are almost always test bugs and should fail loud at the offending call site, not at a deferred Result assertion further down. Use `SaveAsync` when you specifically want to test handler behavior on conflict (where the `Error.Conflict` Result is the system-under-test, not a setup mistake).

**DI prerequisites checklist.**

```csharp
services
    .AddTrellisBehaviors()                              // validation/logging/tracing
    .AddTrellisFluentValidation(typeof(MyValidator).Assembly)
    .AddTrellisUnitOfWork<AppDbContext>()               // ⬅ registers TransactionalCommandBehavior
    .AddScoped<IOrderRepository, EfOrderRepository>();
```

Without `AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>()`, `repo.Add(order)` stages the entity but **nothing ever calls `SaveChangesAsync`** — handler tests against EF (or against a real database) silently insert nothing. This is the production analogue of the fake/real divergence trap covered in [Recipe 8](#recipe-8--ef-core-maybepropertymapping-for-nullable-value-objects): the tests pass against `FakeRepository` (which has no UoW boundary, so `Add` is immediately visible), and production silently commits nothing. Always wire `AddTrellisUnitOfWork` in the ACL composition root, not inside each handler.

## Recipe 17 — Defining custom domain events: `OccurredAt` is the only timestamp

**Problem.** You're modeling an order workflow and reach for a domain event:

```csharp
// ❌ Wrong — CS0535 'OrderSubmitted does not implement IDomainEvent.OccurredAt'
public sealed record OrderSubmitted(OrderId OrderId, Money Total, DateTimeOffset SubmittedAt) : IDomainEvent;
```

The compile error is unambiguous, but the obvious "fix" — adding `OccurredAt` *alongside* `SubmittedAt` — is the wrong shape:

```csharp
// ❌ Wrong — duplicate timestamps. SubmittedAt and OccurredAt always carry the same value.
public sealed record OrderSubmitted(OrderId OrderId, Money Total, DateTimeOffset SubmittedAt, DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;
```

**Fix.** `OccurredAt` is the canonical, only timestamp on every domain event. The semantic meaning ("when the order was submitted") is carried by the *event type name* (`OrderSubmitted`), not by a parallel timestamp field. Drop the semantic alias:

```csharp
// ✅ Correct — OccurredAt is the timestamp; the event name carries the semantic.
public sealed record OrderSubmitted(OrderId OrderId, Money Total, DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;
public sealed record OrderApproved(OrderId OrderId, ActorId ApprovedBy, DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;
public sealed record OrderShipped(OrderId OrderId, TrackingNumber Tracking, DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;
```

**Raising the event.** Always pass `TimeProvider.GetUtcNow()` (the .NET 8 testable-clock primitive returns `DateTimeOffset` directly — no conversion needed). The aggregate's domain method, not the event constructor, is where time enters the system:

```csharp
public Result<Order> Submit(TimeProvider clock)
{
    return this.ToResult()
        .Ensure(_ => Status == OrderStatus.Draft, Error.InvalidInput.ForRule("order.already-submitted", "Already submitted"))
        .Tap(_ =>
        {
            Status = OrderStatus.Submitted;
            DomainEvents.Add(new OrderSubmitted(Id, Total, clock.GetUtcNow()));
        });
}
```

**On the aggregate.** If your aggregate also exposes a public `SubmittedAt` property (e.g., to drive UI sort order or read-model projections), source it from the event timestamp at write time — don't track it independently:

```csharp
public DateTimeOffset? SubmittedAt { get; private set; }

public Result<Order> Submit(TimeProvider clock)
{
    var occurredAt = clock.GetUtcNow();
    // ... ensure rules ...
    Status = OrderStatus.Submitted;
    SubmittedAt = occurredAt;
    DomainEvents.Add(new OrderSubmitted(Id, Total, occurredAt));
    return Result.Ok(this);
}
```

**Why a single timestamp.** Domain events flow into outbox tables, integration buses, audit projections, and event-sourced read models. Every consumer assumes `OccurredAt` is *the* occurrence time. Adding `SubmittedAt`/`ApprovedAt`/`ShippedAt` to individual events forces every consumer to know which field to project per event type — and the two fields can drift if the aggregate's setter and the event constructor are passed different `clock.GetUtcNow()` calls.

**Why `DateTimeOffset`.** `OccurredAt` is `DateTimeOffset` (not `DateTime`) so the explicit offset is a part of the value and round-trips unambiguously through serialization. `TimeProvider.GetUtcNow()` returns `DateTimeOffset` directly — events stored in outbox tables, integration buses, and audit projections retain their authored instant without timezone-loss bugs.

**See also.** The XML doc on `IDomainEvent.OccurredAt` (in `Trellis.Core`) calls this out explicitly. If your IDE shows the doc on hover, the rule is right there before you hit the compile error.

## Recipe 18 — DTO primitives to value-object command: no test-only `Unwrap()`

**Problem.** Request DTOs often carry primitive transport fields (`string email`, `string customerName`), while commands and domain methods should receive Trellis value objects. Each `TryCreate` returns `Result<TVO>`. Do not use `Unwrap()` in production code — it is a `Trellis.Testing` helper for tests.

```csharp
using Mediator;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp;
using Trellis.Primitives;

public sealed record CreateCustomerRequest(string Email, string CustomerName);

public sealed partial class CustomerId : RequiredGuid<CustomerId>;

public sealed record CustomerResponse(CustomerId Id, string Email, string CustomerName);

[StringLength(200, MinimumLength = 1)]
public sealed partial class CustomerName : RequiredString<CustomerName>;

public sealed record CreateCustomerCommand(EmailAddress Email, CustomerName CustomerName)
    : ICommand<Result<CustomerResponse>>
{
    public static Result<CreateCustomerCommand> TryCreate(CreateCustomerRequest request) =>
        Result.Combine(
                EmailAddress.TryCreate(request.Email, nameof(request.Email)),
                CustomerName.TryCreate(request.CustomerName, nameof(request.CustomerName)))
            .Map((email, customerName) => new CreateCustomerCommand(email, customerName));
}

[ApiController]
[Route("customers")]
public sealed class CustomersController(ISender sender) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public ValueTask<ActionResult<CustomerResponse>> Create(
        [FromBody] CreateCustomerRequest request,
        CancellationToken ct) =>
        CreateCustomerCommand.TryCreate(request)
            .BindAsync(command => sender.Send(command, ct))
            .ToHttpResponseAsync()
            .AsActionResultAsync<CustomerResponse>();
}
```

**What it shows.**

- Keep DTOs transport-shaped and commands/domain methods value-object-shaped.
- Pass field names into `TryCreate` so failures point at the request field (`/Email`, `/CustomerName` after pointer normalization at the ASP boundary).
- Use `Result.Combine(...)` to aggregate per-field `Error.InvalidInput` failures into one validation response.
- Stay on the ROP track: invalid input short-circuits before `sender.Send(...)`; valid input creates the command and continues.

**Anti-pattern -> fix.**

```csharp
// WRONG — Unwrap() is test-only and turns validation failures into thrown exceptions.
var command = new CreateCustomerCommand(
    EmailAddress.TryCreate(request.Email).Unwrap(),
    CustomerName.TryCreate(request.CustomerName).Unwrap());

// FIX — aggregate value-object creation results and bind into the command.
var command = Result.Combine(
        EmailAddress.TryCreate(request.Email, nameof(request.Email)),
        CustomerName.TryCreate(request.CustomerName, nameof(request.CustomerName)))
    .Map((email, customerName) => new CreateCustomerCommand(email, customerName));
```

## Recipe 19 — HTTP client result safety and optional reads

**Problem.** Call an upstream HTTP resource safely, preserving non-success status codes as Trellis errors and treating a missing optional resource as `Maybe.None`.

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Http;

[JsonSerializable(typeof(OrderDto))]
public sealed partial class OrderJsonContext : JsonSerializerContext;

public sealed record OrderDto(Guid Id, decimal Total);

public Task<Result<OrderDto>> GetRequiredOrderAsync(HttpClient client, Guid id, CancellationToken ct) =>
    client.GetAsync($"/orders/{id}", ct)
        .ToResultAsync()
        .ReadJsonAsync(OrderJsonContext.Default.OrderDto, ct);

public Task<Result<Maybe<OrderDto>>> FindOrderAsync(HttpClient client, Guid id, CancellationToken ct) =>
    client.GetAsync($"/orders/{id}", ct)
        .ReadJsonOrNoneOn404Async(OrderJsonContext.Default.OrderDto, ct);
```

**What it shows.**

- Bare `ToResultAsync()` is strict in v3: 2xx responses stay on the success track; non-2xx responses become typed Trellis errors.
- Use `ReadJsonOrNoneOn404Async(...)` when `404` is expected domain absence, not failure.
- Use explicit status mapping only when the upstream status needs a domain-specific resource or policy:

```csharp
client.GetAsync($"/orders/{id}", ct)
    .ToResultAsync(status => status == HttpStatusCode.NotFound
        ? new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<OrderDto>(id))
        : null)
    .ReadJsonAsync(OrderJsonContext.Default.OrderDto, ct);
```

## Recipe 20 — Fail-fast vs accumulating: `Sequence`/`Traverse` vs `SequenceAll`/`TraverseAll`

**Problem.** A single pipeline contains two distinct collection-level concerns:

1. **Form-style validation** of a batch payload — every invalid row should be reported in one response, not just the first.
2. **A fan-out fetch** — once one upstream fetch fails, finishing the rest is wasted I/O; the first failure should win.

Trellis ships both shapes on the same surface so you can pick the semantics per call site.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Primitives;

public sealed record CreateContactRow(string Email, string Name);

// 1) Accumulating: every row's failure surfaces in the response.
public Result<IReadOnlyList<EmailAddress>> ValidateAddresses(IEnumerable<CreateContactRow> rows) =>
    rows.TraverseAll(row => EmailAddress.TryCreate(row.Email));
//        ↑ TraverseAll runs the selector for every row.
//          - All succeed   → Ok(list)
//          - One bad email → that single Error.InvalidInput (no Aggregate wrap)
//          - Many bad      → one merged Error.InvalidInput whose
//                            Fields/Rules concatenate every per-item violation
//          - Mixed kinds   → flat Error.Aggregate of every distinct error

// 2) Fail-fast: stop on the first upstream miss.
public Task<Result<IReadOnlyList<Order>>> LoadOrders(IEnumerable<OrderId> ids, CancellationToken ct) =>
    ids.TraverseAsync((id, c) => repo.LoadAsync(id, c), ct);
//        ↑ TraverseAsync short-circuits on the first failure — no
//          subsequent repository calls are issued.
```

**What it shows.**

- `TraverseAll` / `SequenceAll` exist precisely to solve "show me every error". They use the same `Error.Combine` extension as `EnsureAll`, so two `InvalidInput` failures merge and unrelated failures flatten into `Error.Aggregate`.
- `Traverse` / `Sequence` exist precisely to solve "stop wasting work on the first failure". They never *accumulate into* an `Error.Aggregate`; they propagate the first failure as-is (which means if a selector itself returns `Result.Fail<T>(new Error.Aggregate(...))`, that `Aggregate` flows through unchanged — not because Traverse created it, but because Traverse preserves whatever the failing selector produced).
- `TraverseAll` ships the same async surface as `Traverse`: sync, `Task`, `Task` + `CancellationToken`, `ValueTask`, `ValueTask` + `CancellationToken`, plus a `Task<Result<Unit>>` + `CancellationToken` overload. `SequenceAll` is sync-only because `Sequence` is sync-only; if async siblings ever land for `Sequence`, they land for `SequenceAll` at the same time.
- Already have an `IEnumerable<Result<T>>` (e.g. from a `Select` over a `TryCreate`)? Pick `.Sequence()` (fail-fast) or `.SequenceAll()` (accumulating); they're the identity-selector forms of `Traverse` / `TraverseAll`.

**Anti-pattern → fix.**

```csharp
// ❌ Manual loop with early return: loses every error after the first.
foreach (var row in rows)
{
    var r = EmailAddress.TryCreate(row.Email);
    if (r.IsFailure) return r.Map(_ => default(IReadOnlyList<EmailAddress>)!);
    parsed.Add(r.Unwrap());
}
// ✅ Explicit choice between fail-fast and accumulating semantics:
return rows.TraverseAll(row => EmailAddress.TryCreate(row.Email));
```

## Recipe 21 — Parallel independent loads in handlers: `Result.ParallelAsync` + `WhenAllAsync`

**Problem.** A handler needs two (or more) loads that are *genuinely* independent — a customer record from one upstream service, a product record from another; an HTTP call to authn plus a DB read for profile; or two reads against two distinct EF Core `DbContext` instances. Written sequentially, each `await` blocks the next, so latency = sum of fetches. Written naively in parallel with `Task.WhenAll`, error handling falls back to throwing, you lose the `Result<T>` track, and the lab evidence shows that authors (human and AI) reach for the sequential form by default because it "looks correct" and the tests pass.

`Result.ParallelAsync(...)` is the framework's opinionated entry point: factory-takes-no-args, eagerly invokes each factory so both tasks actually run concurrently, returns a tuple of `Task<Result<T>>` that the matching `.WhenAllAsync()` extension awaits with `Task.WhenAll` and folds via `Result.Combine` into a single `Result<(T1, T2, …)>`. Failures combine through `Error.Combine`, so two `Error.InvalidInput` failures merge their fields, heterogeneous failures become an `Error.Aggregate`.

> 🛑 **Danger — `Result.ParallelAsync` against repositories that share a `DbContext` instance will race and throw.** The hard rule, independent of DI: **never start a second operation on a `DbContext` before the first one has completed.** EF Core's `DbContext` is documented as not thread-safe; the second concurrent operation throws `InvalidOperationException: A second operation was started on this context instance before a previous operation completed.` The typical Trellis EF wiring triggers this case by construction: `services.AddDbContext<TContext>(...)` registers the context with its default scoped lifetime (this is the default of the parameterless overload — `AddDbContext<TContext>(..., ServiceLifetime)` can override it), and `services.AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>()` registers `IUnitOfWork` as scoped and consumes the scoped `TContext`. So **every repository resolved from the same request scope shares one `DbContext` instance**, and parallelising two repository reads parallelises two operations on that one context. Keep them sequential — see "When NOT to use it" below. `Result.ParallelAsync` is for genuinely cross-resource concurrency (HTTP + DB, two distinct upstream services, factory-created independent contexts), not for two repository reads against the same store.

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Mediator;
using Trellis;

public sealed record CheckoutCommand(UserId UserId, ProductSku Sku) : ICommand<Result<CheckoutQuote>>;

// Genuinely cross-resource: one upstream HTTP call + one read against a DIFFERENT
// store (a pricing cache). These have no shared state and run safely in parallel.
public sealed class CheckoutHandler(
    IUserDirectoryClient directory,   // outbound HTTP
    IPricingCache pricing)            // independent in-memory store
    : ICommandHandler<CheckoutCommand, Result<CheckoutQuote>>
{
    public ValueTask<Result<CheckoutQuote>> Handle(CheckoutCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        new(Result.ParallelAsync(
                //  ↑ takes parameterless factory funcs — NOT pre-started tasks.
                //    Each factory is invoked eagerly here so both fetches execute concurrently.
                () => directory.FindUserAsync(command.UserId, cancellationToken),
                () => pricing.GetQuoteAsync(command.Sku, cancellationToken))
            .WhenAllAsync()
            //  ↑ awaits Task.WhenAll, folds the two Result<T> into Result<(User, Quote)>
            //    via Result.Combine. Two Error.InvalidInput failures merge their
            //    Fields/Rules; heterogeneous errors flatten into Error.Aggregate.
            .BindAsync(t => CheckoutQuote.Create(t.Item1, t.Item2, command.Sku)));
}
```

**What it shows.**

- `Result.ParallelAsync` takes `Func<Task<Result<T>>>` factories, NOT `Task<Result<T>>` instances. The factory shape is the API's only safeguard against the "I started the tasks before passing them in" mistake that makes them sequential anyway.
- `.WhenAllAsync()` on the tuple is the matching extension. Without it you still have a tuple of `Task<Result<T>>` — which isn't awaitable on its own; you'd have to await each task individually and combine the results by hand. `.WhenAllAsync()` is the one-line fold.
- The combined `Result<(T1, T2)>` flows back into the standard ROP chain (`BindAsync`, `MapAsync`, `TapAsync`) — no `match` / `if (success)` branches.
- `Result.ParallelAsync` ships overloads for 2–9 factories. For collections, prefer `TraverseAsync` ([Recipe 20](#recipe-20--fail-fast-vs-accumulating-sequencetraverse-vs-sequencealltraverseall)) — it's the right tool when the count is dynamic.

**When NOT to use it.**

1. **Two or more repositories sharing the same scoped `DbContext`.** The most common case in a typical Trellis service. The repos look independent at the C# level, but they all resolve `IRepositoryBase<T, TId>` from the same scoped `TContext`. Parallelising them races the underlying connection and throws `InvalidOperationException`. **Keep sequential `Bind` for this case** — the savings vs the sum-of-fetches are negligible against a local DB anyway, and the integrity loss is real.
2. **The second factory's body references a value produced by the first.** Not independent — keep the sequential `BindAsync` chain. The rule is mechanical: if the second load requires data the first one produced (an id, a filter, a cursor), the two are sequential by definition.
3. **Side-effecting writes.** `Result.ParallelAsync` is for reads. Parallel `repository.Add(...)` calls against a shared context have the same race as parallel reads, plus tracker contention; parallel writes against per-scope contexts need transaction coordination outside this helper.

**Anti-pattern → fix.**

```csharp
// ❌ UNSAFE — two repository calls against repositories that share a scoped DbContext.
// Looks "obviously parallelisable" but races the underlying EF context. `Task.WhenAll`
// waits for both factories to complete (or one to throw), so the concrete failure mode
// is an `InvalidOperationException("A second operation was started on this context...")`
// thrown by EF Core when the second concurrent operation hits the shared connection.
// Reproduction is timing-dependent: the throw is reliable under contention but can be
// missed on a near-instant warm cache, which lulls authors into thinking it's correct.
public ValueTask<Result<DraftOrderId>> Handle(CreateDraftOrderCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
    new(Result.ParallelAsync(
            () => _customers.FindByIdAsync(command.CustomerId, cancellationToken),  // shared DbContext
            () => _products.FindByIdAsync(command.ProductId, cancellationToken))    // shared DbContext
        .WhenAllAsync()
        .BindAsync(t => DraftOrder.CreateDraft(t.Item1, t.Item2, command.Quantity))
        .TapAsync(_orders.Add)
        .MapAsync(o => o.Id));

// ✅ Sequential against a shared DbContext — correct by construction. The latency
// cost is the sum of two local reads, which is negligible in practice.
public async ValueTask<Result<DraftOrderId>> Handle(CreateDraftOrderCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var customerResult = await _customers.FindByIdAsync(command.CustomerId, cancellationToken);
    var productResult  = await _products.FindByIdAsync(command.ProductId, cancellationToken);

    return Result.Combine(customerResult, productResult)
        .Bind(t => DraftOrder.CreateDraft(t.Item1, t.Item2, command.Quantity))
        .Tap(_orders.Add)
        .Map(o => o.Id);
}

// ✅ Truly parallel — only when the two loads hit independent resources. The HTTP
// call and the in-memory cache have no shared state; ParallelAsync is safe here.
//
// For two EF reads in genuine parallel, inject `IDbContextFactory<TContext>` and
// open two short-lived contexts inside the handler:
//
//   await using var aCtx = await _factory.CreateDbContextAsync(ct);
//   await using var bCtx = await _factory.CreateDbContextAsync(ct);
//   // ... use aCtx and bCtx independently inside ParallelAsync factories ...
//
// The trade-off: two extra contexts and their connections per request, in exchange
// for parallel reads. Worth it only when the queries are slow.
```

## Recipe 22 — Multi-aggregate orchestration: fail-loud on missing related aggregates

**Problem.** A command needs to mutate one primary aggregate (an Order) and trigger a side effect on each element of a related-aggregate set (release reserved stock on every Product referenced by the Order's line items). The naive shape is a `foreach` with a dictionary lookup of the related aggregate by id. If a referenced related aggregate is missing from that lookup — invariant violation; under normal flow it should never happen — what is the correct behaviour?

The wrong answer: `if (!dict.TryGetValue(id, out var related)) continue;` and move on. The handler appears to succeed, the primary aggregate transitions, the unit of work commits, and the side effect is silently skipped for the missing element. The orchestration has broken its own post-condition ("stock is released for every line item") with no signal to the caller and no rollback.

The right answer: fail-loud. Return `Error.NotFound` referencing the missing related aggregate so the unit of work rolls back the primary aggregate's mutation. The invariant — "every line item resolves to a Product, or the command fails atomically" — is now enforced and observable.

Two operating principles drive the snippet below:

- **Preflight before mutating, not during.** An in-memory aggregate mutation persists through the rest of the handler's object graph even if the later database commit rolls back. So a release-then-discover pattern leaks partially-released stock into any subsequent read of the same aggregate within the request scope. Compute the missing-set *before* any side effect.
- **Report the full problem.** That's the value of preflighting — surface every missing id in one round-trip via `Error.Aggregate`, with each missing id keeping its own structured `ResourceRef`. (This recipe assumes product ids are non-sensitive; if your threat model differs, drop the per-id refs and emit a single generic `NotFound`.)

```csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Mediator;
using Trellis;

public sealed class ReturnOrderHandler(
    IOrderRepository orders,
    IProductRepository products,
    TimeProvider timeProvider) : ICommandHandler<ReturnOrderCommand, Result<Order>>
{
    public async ValueTask<Result<Order>> Handle(ReturnOrderCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Repository find returns Result<T> — matches Recipe 21's repository shape;
        // .TryGetValue extracts the success value or short-circuits on the existing Error.
        var orderResult = await orders.FindByIdAsync(command.OrderId, cancellationToken);
        if (!orderResult.TryGetValue(out var order))
            return orderResult;

        // Batch fetch returns what it found — the set-difference is the orchestrator's job.
        var productIds = order.LineItems.Select(li => li.ProductId).Distinct().ToArray();
        var loaded = await products.GetByIdsAsync(productIds, cancellationToken);
        var byId = loaded.ToDictionary(p => p.Id);

        // Preflight: prove EVERY related aggregate is reachable BEFORE any side effect.
        // NEVER `continue` past a missing related aggregate, and NEVER mutate before the
        // set is fully reachable. Report ALL missing ids via Error.Aggregate.
        static Error NotFoundFor(ProductId id) => new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<Product>(id))
        {
            Detail = "Product referenced by line item is missing — cannot release stock.",
        };
        var missing = productIds.Where(id => !byId.ContainsKey(id)).ToArray();
        if (missing.Length == 1)
            return Result.Fail<Order>(NotFoundFor(missing[0]));
        if (missing.Length > 1)
            return Result.Fail<Order>(new Error.Aggregate(missing.Select(NotFoundFor).ToArray()));

        // All related aggregates reachable. Preflight the per-aggregate domain
        // invariants (Recipe 25: pure CanReleaseStock predicate paired with the
        // mutating ReleaseStock) before any mutation. Releasing stock on Product
        // A and then failing on Product B's release would leave A in a partially-
        // released state that TransactionalCommandBehavior cannot roll back from
        // the in-memory aggregate graph within the same request.
        var preflight = order.LineItems
            .Select(li => byId[li.ProductId].CanReleaseStock(li.Quantity))
            .SequenceAll();
        if (preflight.IsFailure)
            return Result.Fail<Order>(preflight.Error);

        // Pass 1 succeeded for every line item — every Pass 2 mutation below has
        // a matching Can* predicate that just returned Ok, so the mutation is
        // provably non-failing. Discard() marks the Result as consciously dropped.
        foreach (var li in order.LineItems)
            byId[li.ProductId].ReleaseStock(li.Quantity).Discard();

        return order.Return(command.Reason, timeProvider.GetUtcNow()).Map(_ => order);
    }
}
```

**The test-design principle: Partial-Failure Atomicity.**

> For every post-condition phrased as *"X is done for every Y in a set,"* write a test where one Y is unreachable at operation time. The post-condition must hold under one of two regimes:
>
> 1. **All-or-nothing:** the operation fails atomically; no X is performed.
> 2. **Best-effort with explicit signal:** every reachable Y has X performed; every unreachable Y produces a recorded error in the result.
>
> The implementation must pick one explicitly. If a "for every" handler silently `continue`s past an unreachable Y with neither failure nor signal, it has broken the post-condition and the unit of work has committed an inconsistent state.
>
> The test must hold the related-aggregate's pre-operation state and assert that no partial side-effect leaked through.

The generator test (the one a coverage-driven author would never produce from a happy-path-only mental model):

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Return_with_missing_product_fails_atomically_and_does_not_release_stock()
{
    // Seed two products A and B; build a Delivered order with line items referencing both.
    var (order, productA, productB) = await SeedDeliveredWithTwoProductsAsync();
    var aStockBefore = productA.StockQuantity;
    var bStockBefore = productB.StockQuantity;

    // Disrupt the universally-quantified set: drop productB from the repository.
    _products.Remove(productB);

    var r = await _sender.Send(new ReturnOrderCommand(order.Id, _reason), cancellationToken);

    // The orchestration MUST be atomic: either every line item's stock is released,
    // or the operation fails and NOTHING is released.
    r.Should().BeFailureOfType<Error.NotFound>();
    productA.StockQuantity.Should().Be(aStockBefore);  // A NOT partially released
    productB.StockQuantity.Should().Be(bStockBefore);  // B unmutated (the handler never reached it)
    order.Status.Should().Be(OrderStatus.Delivered);    // Order NOT transitioned (UoW rolls back)
}
```

**Generalisation.** Anywhere a handler does:

```csharp
foreach (var x in someSet)
{
    if (!cache.TryGetValue(x.RelatedId, out var related))
        continue;                              // ❌ silent skip — see anti-pattern below
    related.SideEffect(x.Args);
}
```

…there is a hidden missing-related-aggregate path. Apply the Partial-Failure Atomicity test pattern to every such loop. Failing tests will not be caught by a happy-path-only suite because every test sets up a known-good related-aggregate set.

**Anti-pattern → fix.**

```csharp
// ❌ Silent skip — passes every happy-path test, but if a Product disappears between
// the order being created and the return being processed (or if a future refactor
// adds a DeleteProduct endpoint), the return "succeeds" with a partially-released
// stock state. No exception, no Result failure, no log entry. Data corruption.
foreach (var li in order.LineItems)
{
    if (!byId.TryGetValue(li.ProductId, out var product))
        continue;                              // ← invariant violation hidden here
    product.ReleaseStock(li.Quantity);
}

// ✅ Fail-loud with full preflight — same shape as the worked example above.
// Compute the missing set BEFORE any side effect; only enter the release loop
// when every related aggregate is reachable.
var missing = order.LineItems.Select(li => li.ProductId).Distinct()
    .Where(id => !byId.ContainsKey(id))
    .ToArray();
if (missing.Length > 0)
    return Result.Fail<Order>(missing.Length == 1
        ? new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<Product>(missing[0]))
        : new Error.Aggregate(missing.Select(id =>
            (Error)new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<Product>(id))).ToArray()));

foreach (var li in order.LineItems)
{
    var product = byId[li.ProductId];
    var release = product.ReleaseStock(li.Quantity);
    if (release.Error is { } err)
        return Result.Fail<Order>(err);
}
```

## Recipe 23 — Concurrency control on aggregate-mutating endpoints: when to require `If-Match`

**Problem.** RFC 9110 §13.1.1 lets clients send `If-Match: "etag"` on unsafe methods to detect stale-read race conditions: if the resource's current ETag doesn't match, the server returns `412 Precondition Failed` instead of overwriting concurrent changes. For mutating handlers, the framework provides `ETagHelper.ParseIfMatch(request)` to extract the typed `EntityTagValue[]` from the incoming `If-Match` header, plus the `Result<T>.OptionalETag(...)` / `RequireETag(...)` extensions (and their `*Async` overloads) that evaluate the precondition at the read-modify-write boundary inside the handler chain. (`opts.WithETag(...).EvaluatePreconditions()` on the response builder is a different feature — it only runs on `GET` / `HEAD` for `If-None-Match` → `304` and `If-Match` → `412` on safe-method reads; it is **not** the mutation hook.) The decision question: which mutating endpoints actually need this?

A blanket "wire `RequireETag` on every mutation" rule is wrong — it adds ceremony to endpoints where there is no lost-update window to begin with. Use the decision table:

| Endpoint shape | Lost-update window? | Use `If-Match`? |
|---|---|---|
| **Body-less state-transition POST** (`POST /orders/{id}/submit`, `.../approve`, `.../cancel`, `.../return`) | **No.** The state machine + transition guards check the current state. A stale client calling `.../approve` on an order that has already shipped gets `422 Unprocessable Content` from the transition guard; there is nothing to overwrite. | **No.** The state machine substitutes for the precondition. Ceremony without benefit. |
| **Body-carrying full-update PUT** (`PUT /orders/{id}` with a full replacement body) | **Yes.** The body silently overwrites whatever the concurrent edit wrote. | **Yes — `RequireETag`.** RFC 6585 says `428 Precondition Required` when missing, RFC 9110 says `412 Precondition Failed` when stale. |
| **Body-carrying partial-update PATCH** with a JSON Patch / JSON Merge Patch document | **Yes.** Same overwrite risk as full update. | **Yes — `RequireETag`.** |
| **Destructive `DELETE /resources/{id}`** | **Yes.** A stale client can delete a version it has not seen after another writer changed it. | **Yes — `RequireETag`** as the default. EF Core's row-version concurrency tokens are **not** an equivalent substitute: they catch concurrent *writes* racing after the row was loaded by the handler, not stale-client reads from before the request. Drop the precondition only if the endpoint is explicitly modeled as a guarded state-machine transition where a stale caller's intent is already invalid by construction. |
| **Additive set operation** (`POST /orders/{id}/line-items`, `POST /products/{id}/stock-additions +5`) | **Maybe.** Depends on commutativity. Two concurrent `+5` calls produce `+10` correctly; "remove the last line item" against a stale read of "list has 2 items" can drop the wrong item. | **Case-by-case.** Commutative additive ops can stay precondition-free; remove-by-position or "remove the last X" operations should `RequireETag` (or `OptionalETag` only when the endpoint deliberately admits unconditional callers). |
| **Resource creation** (`POST /customers`, `POST /products`) | **N/A.** No prior version to match against. | **No.** |

```csharp
using Mediator;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Asp;
using Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore;

// State-transition POST — no If-Match. The state machine guards the transition.
app.MapPost("/orders/{id:guid}/approve", (OrderId id, ISender sender, CancellationToken ct) =>
    sender.Send(new ApproveOrderCommand(id), ct)
        .ToHttpResponseAsync(OrderResponse.From));

// Full-update PUT — RequireETag at the read-modify-write boundary.
// Missing If-Match → 428; stale → 412; current → proceeds.
app.MapPut("/orders/{id:guid}", (OrderId id, ReplaceOrderRequest request, OrderDbContext db, HttpContext httpContext, CancellationToken ct) =>
    db.Orders
        .FirstOrDefaultResultAsync(o => o.Id == id, new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<Order>(id)), ct)
        .RequireETagAsync(ETagHelper.ParseIfMatch(httpContext.Request))
        .BindAsync(o => o.Replace(request))
        .CheckAsync(_ => db.SaveChangesResultUnitAsync(ct))
        .ToHttpResponseAsync(OrderResponse.From, opts => opts.HonorPrefer()));
```

> **Direct `DbContext` in the Minimal API lambda vs command handler via Mediator.** Both shapes are canonical Trellis. This recipe shows the direct-`DbContext` shape because the precondition (`RequireETag`) belongs at the *read-modify-write* boundary — the same atomic unit where the read happens. If you prefer to dispatch through a command handler, move the same chain (`db.Orders.FirstOrDefaultResultAsync(...).RequireETagAsync(...).BindAsync(...).CheckAsync(_ => db.SaveChangesResultUnitAsync(ct))`) into the handler body; `TransactionalCommandBehavior` then owns the commit, and `db.SaveChangesResultUnitAsync(...)` becomes redundant (drop the `.CheckAsync` step). The precondition placement does not change — it still wraps the freshly-loaded aggregate and runs before any mutation.

**Rationale.** The framework helper is fine; the decision is whether the endpoint's semantics admit a lost-update window. State machines, additive set operations, and resource creation each carry their own concurrency control inside the domain or in the absence of prior state. Only payload-carrying overwrites need explicit precondition checking.

## Cross-cutting tips

- **Run analyzers in CI.** `Trellis.Analyzers` ships in the framework and runs as part of every `dotnet build`. Treat warnings as errors for `TRLS00x` once your codebase is clean.
- **Two independent `await` calls in a handler?** `Result.ParallelAsync` + `WhenAllAsync` is the framework idiom — **but only when the loads hit different resources**. Two repository reads against the same scoped `DbContext` (the typical Trellis setup with `AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>()`) race EF Core and throw `InvalidOperationException`; keep those sequential. The recipe spells out the safe shapes (HTTP + DB, two distinct upstream services, factory-created `DbContext`s via `IDbContextFactory<T>`) and the anti-pattern. See [Recipe 21](#recipe-21--parallel-independent-loads-in-handlers-resultparallelasync--whenallasync). The rule for "independent": the second factory's body does not reference any value produced by the first **and** the two factories hit distinct underlying resources.
- **Do not mix sync chain methods with async lambdas.** `result.Map(async v => …)` triggers `TRLS009`; use `MapAsync`. The fix provider can apply this rewrite automatically.
- **Construct errors via the closed ADT.** `new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<Order>(id))` — never `new Error("not_found", "...")`, which won't compile against the abstract base record.
- **Use `Result.Combine` (or `EnsureAll`) for accumulating validation.** Manual `IsSuccess` checks across multiple results trigger `TRLS008`.
- **Aggregate per-item Results with `Traverse` / `Sequence` (fail-fast) or `TraverseAll` / `SequenceAll` (accumulating).** When you have a collection and a per-item function returning `Result<T>`, use `items.Traverse(item => Compute(item))` to lift it into `Result<IReadOnlyList<T>>`. When you already have an `IEnumerable<Result<T>>` (e.g., from a `Select`), call `.Sequence()` instead. Both short-circuit on the first failure. When you need to surface every failure (form-style validation), use `TraverseAll` / `SequenceAll`: they run through every item and fold failures via `Error.Combine` — two `UnprocessableContent` errors merge their fields/rules, heterogeneous errors flatten into `Error.Aggregate`. See [Recipe 20](#recipe-20--fail-fast-vs-accumulating-sequencetraverse-vs-sequencealltraverseall) for when to choose which.
- **Use `Error.InvalidInput.ForField` / `.ForRule` for single-violation 422s.** The most common shape (every primitive `TryCreate`, every value-object invariant, every `RequiredEnum`/`RequiredString` failure) is a single `FieldViolation` or a single `RuleViolation`. Use the factories instead of the verbose constructor: `Error.InvalidInput.ForField("email", "invalid_format", "must contain @")` over `new Error.InvalidInput(EquatableArray.Create(new FieldViolation(InputPointer.ForProperty("email"), "invalid_format") { Detail = "must contain @" }))`. There is also `ForField(InputPointer field, …)` for nested/array pointers (e.g. `new InputPointer("/items/0/quantity")`) or `InputPointer.Root` for whole-body violations, and `ForRule(reasonCode, detail)` for global rules. For aggregating multiple per-field violations into one error (e.g. composite VO `TryCreate`), keep the manual constructor with an `EquatableArray<FieldViolation>` or use the `Validate` builder.
- **`InputPointer.Root` for whole-body violations.** Use `InputPointer.ForProperty(name)` for field-level violations and `InputPointer.Root` when the rule is object-level.
- **Only the `Trellis` namespace is auto-imported.** The template's implicit usings include `Trellis` (which exposes `Result`, `Result<T>`, `Error`, `Maybe<T>`, `RequiredString<T>`, `RequiredGuid<T>`, `RequiredInt<T>`, `RequiredDecimal<T>`, `RequiredDateTime<T>`, etc.). Every other Trellis namespace requires an explicit `using` per file — e.g. `using Trellis.Primitives;` for `Money` / `EmailAddress` / `PhoneNumber` / `MonetaryAmount` / `CurrencyCode` / `CountryCode` / etc., `using Stateless;` for the upstream `StateMachine<TState, TTrigger>` type plus `using Trellis.StateMachine;` for the Trellis `FireResult` extension and `LazyStateMachine<TState, TTrigger>`, `using Trellis.Authorization;` for permission types. This is intentional: implicit usings cannot be added at the template level without breaking services that don't reference the package.
- **Accessing `Maybe<T>.Value` inside `Expression<Func<...>>` lambdas (EF Core `Where`/`Select`, FluentValidation `RuleFor`, Specifications):** TRLS003 still applies inside expression trees, but it now recognises the multi-clause guard — `e => e.Status == X && e.Y.HasValue && e.Y.Value == y` is analyzer-clean, and `MaybeQueryInterceptor` translates each clause faithfully to SQL when `AddTrellisInterceptors()` is wired. The single-call equivalent `e.Y.HasValueWhere(v => v == y)` is also analyzer-clean and rewritten by the interceptor — use whichever reads better. Hoist into a guarded variable for projections that the interceptor doesn't cover. Do not suppress with `#pragma warning disable TRLS003`. See [Recipe 8](#recipe-8--ef-core-maybepropertymapping-for-nullable-value-objects) for the full Specification walkthrough.
- **`EquatableArray<T>` does not implement `IEnumerable<T>` — project through `.Items` for LINQ / FluentAssertions / `string.Join`.** The sequence-equality wrapper exposes a duck-typed `GetEnumerator()` for allocation-free `foreach` but deliberately does not implement `IEnumerable<T>`. LINQ extension methods (`Select`, `Where`, `Any`, `ToList`) and FluentAssertions extensions (`Should().ContainSingle()`, `Should().HaveCount(...)`, `Should().BeEquivalentTo(...)`) bind on `IEnumerable<T>` and will not compile against the raw wrapper. Call `.Items` first — it returns the wrapped `ImmutableArray<T>`, which IS `IEnumerable<T>`. This shows up most often in test assertions on `Error.InvalidInput.Fields` / `.Rules` and in error-rendering helpers. See [`EquatableArray<T>`](trellis-api-core.md#public-readonly-struct-equatablearrayt--iequatableequatablearrayt) in the Core reference for the worked example.

## Recipe 24 — Indirect (multi-hop) resource authorization

**Problem.** A command identifies a "leaf" resource by id (e.g. `MatchId`) but ownership/authorization is determined by a different resource one or more navigation hops away. Examples:

- **Cricket fan-out**: actor must own home OR away team to upload a scorecard. `Match → {HomeTeam, AwayTeam}`, OR-ownership.
- **Owner chain**: `Match → Team → Tournament` — authorize against tournament owner.
- **Org hierarchy**: `Document → Folder` where `Folder` carries the org-unit owning the document.

The naive workaround is a per-handler ownership guard (e.g. cricket's old `MatchOwnershipGuard`). It runs inside the handler body **after** the framework authorization pipeline has already passed, must be remembered in every handler, and is easy to forget — making it a recurring source of authorization gaps. `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>` moves the check into the framework pipeline as a declarative interface.

**Decision table.**

| Scenario | Recipe |
|---|---|
| Authorize against the resource the command identifies | `IAuthorizeResource<T>` (Recipe 7) |
| Authorize against a single related resource one FK hop away | `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>` + `IIdentifyRelatedResource<TOwner, TOwnerId>` on the leaf |
| Authorize against a set of related resources (cricket fan-out, OR-ownership) | `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>` + `IIdentifyRelatedResources<TOwner, TOwnerId>` on the leaf |
| Authorize against a resource at the end of a chain (`Match → Team → Tournament`) | `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TFinalOwner>` + `IIdentifyRelatedResource<,>` declared on each intermediate entity |
| Authorize against a recursive hierarchy (org-unit ancestors, comment-thread parents) | Materialize the ancestor chain on the loaded aggregate (closure-table projection) and use zero-hop `IAuthorizeResource<T>`; OR a custom `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TProjection>` |
| Authorize against a composite shape (joins, projections, conditional paths, plural-in-middle) | `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TProjection>` returning a custom projection; put `IAuthorizeResource<TProjection>` on the command |

### Cricket fan-out — end to end

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Authorization;

public sealed partial class MatchId : RequiredGuid<MatchId>;
public sealed partial class TeamId  : RequiredGuid<TeamId>;

public sealed class Match : Aggregate<MatchId>, IIdentifyRelatedResources<Team, TeamId>
{
    public TeamId HomeTeamId { get; }
    public TeamId AwayTeamId { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<TeamId> GetRelatedResourceIds() => [HomeTeamId, AwayTeamId];
}

public sealed class Team : Aggregate<TeamId>
{
    public ActorId CreatedByActorId { get; }
}

public sealed record UploadScorecardCommand(MatchId MatchId, /* fields */)
    : ICommand<Result<Unit>>,
      IAuthorizeResourceVia<Team>,
      IIdentifyResource<Match, MatchId>
{
    public MatchId GetResourceId() => MatchId;

    public IResult Authorize(Actor actor, IReadOnlyList<Team> owners) =>
        Result.Ensure(
            owners.Any(t => t.CreatedByActorId == actor.Id),
            new Error.Forbidden("match.upload-scorecard")
                { Detail = "Actor does not own either match team." });
}

// Composition root — assembly scan registers everything.
services.AddTrellisBehaviors();
services.AddResourceAuthorization(typeof(UploadScorecardCommand).Assembly);
```

The pipeline:
1. Resolves the actor.
2. Loads the `Match` via the existing `SharedResourceLoaderById<Match, MatchId>` (bridged automatically because the command implements `IIdentifyResource<Match, MatchId>`).
3. Calls `match.GetRelatedResourceIds()` → `[home, away]`, deduplicates, loads each via `SharedResourceLoaderById<Team, TeamId>`.
4. Calls `command.Authorize(actor, [homeTeam, awayTeam])`.
5. On any leaf-load failure, the loader's error bubbles. On any **intermediate** or owner-load failure, the pipeline collapses to `Error.Forbidden` (no existence leak). Empty ID list at any hop short-circuits to `Forbidden` without invoking `Authorize`.

### Chain — `Match → Team → Tournament`

```csharp
public sealed class Match : Aggregate<MatchId>, IIdentifyRelatedResource<Team, TeamId>
{
    public TeamId TeamId { get; }
    public TeamId GetRelatedResourceId() => TeamId;
}

public sealed class Team : Aggregate<TeamId>, IIdentifyRelatedResource<Tournament, TournamentId>
{
    public TournamentId TournamentId { get; }
    public TournamentId GetRelatedResourceId() => TournamentId;
}

public sealed record CancelMatchCommand(MatchId MatchId)
    : ICommand<Result<Unit>>,
      IAuthorizeResourceVia<Tournament>,
      IIdentifyResource<Match, MatchId>
{
    public MatchId GetResourceId() => MatchId;

    public IResult Authorize(Actor actor, IReadOnlyList<Tournament> owners) =>
        Result.Ensure(
            owners[0].OwnerActorId == actor.Id,
            new Error.Forbidden("match.cancel"));
}
```

The resolver discovers the path `Match → Team → Tournament` at registration time using the entity-side `IIdentifyRelatedResource<,>` declarations. **Singular chains always pass `IReadOnlyList<TOwner>` of size 1** — index `[0]` is safe.

### AOT / explicit registration

`AddResourceAuthorization(Assembly[])` uses reflection. For Native AOT or trimming-strict deployments, register each via-command explicitly. The single-hop overload covers a leaf with one foreign key to its owner (singular extractor). It does **not** support fan-out — for that, drop to the hand-built `ResolvedAuthorizationPath` overload.

```csharp
// Single-hop scenario: Match has one Team FK; the actor must own that team.
public sealed class Match : Aggregate<MatchId>, IIdentifyRelatedResource<Team, TeamId>
{
    public TeamId TeamId { get; }
    public TeamId GetRelatedResourceId() => TeamId;
}

public sealed record DeleteMatchCommand(MatchId MatchId)
    : ICommand<Result<Unit>>,
      IAuthorizeResourceVia<Team>,
      IIdentifyResource<Match, MatchId>
{
    public MatchId GetResourceId() => MatchId;

    public IResult Authorize(Actor actor, IReadOnlyList<Team> owners) =>
        Result.Ensure(
            owners[0].CreatedByActorId == actor.Id,
            new Error.Forbidden("match.delete"));
}

services.AddRelatedResourceAuthorization<
    DeleteMatchCommand, Match, MatchId, Team, TeamId, Result<Unit>>(
    extractOwnerId: match => match.TeamId);  // single-hop selector
```

For chains (`Match → Team → Tournament`) or fan-out (cricket `Match → {HomeTeam, AwayTeam}`), the single-hop overload cannot express the path. Build a `ResolvedAuthorizationPath` manually and use the `(this IServiceCollection, ResolvedAuthorizationPath)` overload — the hand-built path can carry multiple hops and a plural terminal hop.

### What the framework rejects at startup

- **Dual-mode commands** — implementing both `IAuthorizeResource<T>` and `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>` on one command. Security primitives are never silently composed.
- **Via-command without `IIdentifyResource<TLeaf, TLeafId>`** — the scanner cannot infer the leaf, so a silent skip would leave the via-marker unprotected. Throws naming the offending command.
- **Multiple distinct simple paths** from leaf to owner (ambiguous). Throws listing every discovered path; disambiguate by removing an `IIdentifyRelatedResource[s]` declaration or by switching to the explicit `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TProjection>` escape hatch.
- **Plural hop in a non-terminal position** — fan-out cartesian expansion is intentionally out of scope for v1.
- **No path** from leaf to owner — declare an `IIdentifyRelatedResource[s]<TOwner, ...>` somewhere along the chain or use the escape hatch.
- **Missing `SharedResourceLoaderById<TTo, TToId>`** registration for any hop — throws `InvalidOperationException` at request time (deployment bug, not authorization denial).

### TOCTOU note

Resource authorization loads happen outside the handler's transaction. Multi-hop widens that window: ownership can change after auth but before handler state changes. If transactional consistency is required, drop to a custom `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TProjection>` that runs inside the handler's transaction or enforce ownership in the handler/repository layer.

## Recipe 25 — Two-pass validate-then-mutate over a collection of related aggregates

**Problem.** A handler iterates a collection that maps one-to-many onto related aggregates and applies an operation that can fail per element (e.g., `SubmitOrderCommand` reserves stock on the `Product` referenced by every `LineItem`). The naïve single-loop shape — call the mutating operation, check the `Result`, return on failure — is the lab convergent miss across two cycles (`findings-2026-04-30.md §3.4`): two out of three models shipped this shape, and the bug only surfaces on tests that arrange a *later* element to fail.

```csharp
// ❌ Single-loop mutate-as-you-validate. Line 1 reserves; line 3 fails InsufficientStock;
// line 1's product is left in the reserved state with no compensating rollback.
foreach (var li in order.LineItems)
{
    var r = byId[li.ProductId].Reserve(li.Quantity);
    if (r.Error is { } err)
        return Result.Fail<Order>(err);
}
return order.Submit();
```

`TransactionalCommandBehavior` rolls the DB commit back on failure, but the in-memory aggregate state stays mutated for the rest of the request — visible to any subsequent code that reads the same aggregate within the request scope, and outright observable in unit tests that arrange the same `Product` instance and assert on its post-handler state.

**The invariant the recipe teaches.**

> Every fallible domain check across every participating aggregate must succeed BEFORE the first state-changing call. A "fallible domain check" is any `Result<T>`-returning operation that can encode a domain rejection. After validation succeeds, every Pass 2 call has a matching `Can*` predicate from Pass 1, so the mutation is provably non-failing — no compensating-rollback machinery required.

**Two design moves make this work.**

- **Pure `Can*` predicate alongside the mutator.** The aggregate exposes a side-effect-free `CanReserve(qty) → Result<Trellis.Unit>` that returns the same domain error the mutator would, and a `Reserve(qty)` that internally delegates to `CanReserve` before mutating. Same shape as Recipe 9's state-machine `CanFire`+`Fire`/`FireResult` pattern, lifted from "single transition on one aggregate" to "collection of operations across many aggregates."
- **Mutation-plan grouping for duplicate keys.** If the input collection can name the same related aggregate twice (e.g., two line items with the same `ProductId`), aggregate the duplicates into a single `(Product, totalQuantity)` plan entry before validating. Validating each line independently against unchanged stock is **not** equivalent to mutating them sequentially: two `CanReserve(3)` calls against `Stock=5` both pass, but the second `Reserve(3)` then fails. Grouping eliminates the aliasing.

> ⚠️ **Per-line invariants must be enforced before grouping.** The plan step (`g.Sum(li => li.Quantity)`) preserves the aggregated quantity but destroys per-line identity. If `LineItem.Quantity` could be `-4`, then a `(5, -4)` pair would group to a valid `1`, slipping a negative quantity past `CanReserve`. In Trellis services per-line invariants are typically enforced at line-item construction (value-object `Quantity : RequiredInt<Quantity>` validating `> 0`, or a private constructor + `TryCreate` factory). If your per-line invariants don't aggregate cleanly into a sum — e.g., "no single line may exceed 100 units" rather than "the total across lines must not exceed available stock" — add an explicit per-line validation pass *before* the grouping step and `Sequence` its results into Pass 1. Production code should also cap each line's `Quantity` (and/or the order's line count) so a sequence of valid positives cannot overflow `int` inside `g.Sum(...)`; `Sum` throws `OverflowException` rather than producing a `Result` failure, which would bypass the pipeline.

**Worked example.**

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Mediator;
using Trellis;

public sealed class Product : Aggregate<ProductId>
{
    public int Stock { get; private set; }

    // Pure predicate — runs in Pass 1, mutates nothing.
    public Result<Trellis.Unit> CanReserve(int quantity) =>
        Result.Ensure(
            quantity > 0 && quantity <= Stock,
            Error.InvalidInput.ForRule(
                "stock.insufficient",
                $"Cannot reserve {quantity} from stock of {Stock}."));

    // Mutator — re-checks via CanReserve as defense in depth so it is safe to call
    // outside the two-pass orchestration. When called after a matching Pass 1 CanReserve
    // succeeded in a single-threaded handler with no intervening mutations, Reserve is
    // provably non-failing.
    public Result<Trellis.Unit> Reserve(int quantity) =>
        CanReserve(quantity).Tap(() => Stock -= quantity);
}

public sealed class Order : Aggregate<OrderId>
{
    public IReadOnlyList<LineItem> LineItems { get; }
    public bool IsSubmitted { get; private set; }

    public Result<Trellis.Unit> CanSubmit() =>
        Result.Ensure(
            LineItems.Count > 0,
            Error.InvalidInput.ForRule(
                "order.empty",
                "Order must have at least one line item to submit."));

    public Result<Order> Submit() =>
        CanSubmit().Tap(() => IsSubmitted = true).Map(_ => this);
}

public sealed class SubmitOrderHandler(
    IOrderRepository orders,
    IProductRepository products) : ICommandHandler<SubmitOrderCommand, Result<Order>>
{
    public async ValueTask<Result<Order>> Handle(SubmitOrderCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var orderResult = await orders.FindByIdAsync(command.OrderId, cancellationToken);
        if (!orderResult.TryGetValue(out var order))
            return orderResult;

        // Recipe 22 preflight (presence check). Every line-item ProductId must resolve
        // BEFORE the plan step, otherwise byId[g.Key] would throw KeyNotFoundException
        // and bypass the Result pipeline. Truncated here for focus — see Recipe 22 for the
        // full Error.Aggregate-per-missing-id shape.
        var productIds = order.LineItems.Select(li => li.ProductId).Distinct().ToArray();

        // PASS 1 — validate every fallible domain check across every aggregate. No mutations.
        // SequenceAll accumulates every violation so the response enumerates them rather than
        // reporting only the first; use .Sequence() for fail-fast semantics (see Recipe 20
        // for the decision criteria).
        var validation = plan

            .Append(order.CanSubmit())
            .SequenceAll();

        if (validation.Error is { } err)
            return Result.Fail<Order>(err);

        // PASS 2 — apply every mutation. Each call is provably non-failing because its
        // matched Can* predicate already passed in Pass 1 AND nothing has mutated the
        // in-memory aggregate state between passes (single-threaded handler). Discard() is
        // the idiomatic acknowledged-discard that suppresses TRLS001.
        foreach (var (product, quantity) in plan)
            product.Reserve(quantity).Discard();

        return order.Submit();
    }
}
```

The complete compile-checked snippet (with duplicate-product-aware test stubs and the anti-pattern `WrongHandler` under `#if FALSE`) lives at `Examples/CookbookSnippets/Recipe25_TwoPassValidateThenMutate.cs` in the framework repository.

**The Pass-2-cannot-fail invariant — what makes it hold.**

The recipe's correctness rests on two preconditions:

1. **Every Pass 2 call has a matching `Can*` in Pass 1.** This is a static property of the handler shape — every mutator invoked after the validation `if (validation.Error is { } err) return ...` boundary must have appeared, by name and arguments, in the Pass 1 expression.
2. **Nothing mutates the participating aggregates between passes.** Trivially satisfied for a single-threaded async handler operating on aggregates loaded into the request scope. **Not satisfied** if Pass 1 and Pass 2 are split across threads, if another handler runs concurrently against the same instances, or if a Pass-1 callback (e.g., a logger) is allowed to mutate state. Do not parallelize the mutation pass.

When both preconditions hold, `Discard()` on each Pass 2 mutator call is correct: TRLS001 is suppressed and the result really cannot fail. If you cannot prove (1) or (2) in your context, you are no longer using the two-pass pattern — you are doing transactional compensation, which needs explicit rollback machinery and is out of scope for this recipe.

**Choosing fail-fast vs accumulating for the validation pass.**

The worked example uses `SequenceAll()` so the response enumerates every violation (typical for form-style and stock-style invariants where the user benefits from seeing all problems at once). Switch to `Sequence()` for fail-fast semantics when later checks are expensive and a single failure is sufficient. See [Recipe 20](#recipe-20--fail-fast-vs-accumulating-sequencetraverse-vs-sequencealltraverseall) for the full decision criteria. Both forms short-circuit on the same boundary: nothing in Pass 2 runs until validation returns `Ok`.

**How this fits with sibling recipes.**

- [Recipe 9](#recipe-9--state-machine-canfire--fire-pattern-with-fireresult) — single-aggregate single-transition variant of the same `Can*`+`*` shape. Recipe 25 generalizes it across many aggregates and many operations.
- [Recipe 20](#recipe-20--fail-fast-vs-accumulating-sequencetraverse-vs-sequencealltraverseall) — the `Sequence`/`SequenceAll` choice for the validation pass.
- [Recipe 22](#recipe-22--multi-aggregate-orchestration-fail-loud-on-missing-related-aggregates) — presence preflight for *missing* related aggregates (a different failure mode from per-element invariants). The two preflights compose: Recipe 22 runs first (every required aggregate exists), then Recipe 25 (every present aggregate's invariants admit the operation).

**Anti-pattern → fix.**

```csharp
// ❌ Single-loop mutate-as-you-validate. The bug is invisible to happy-path tests because
// every test sets up a fully-satisfiable order. A test that arranges line 3 to fail —
// e.g., line 3's product has Stock=0 — reveals that line 1's product is left reserved.
foreach (var li in order.LineItems)
{
    var r = byId[li.ProductId].Reserve(li.Quantity);
    if (r.Error is { } err)
        return Result.Fail<Order>(err);
}
return order.Submit();

// ✅ Two-pass validate-then-mutate — same shape as the worked example above. Pass 1
// proves every Can* succeeds across every participating aggregate; Pass 2 then calls
// the matching mutators with provably-non-failing semantics.
var plan = order.LineItems
    .GroupBy(li => li.ProductId)
    .Select(g => (Product: byId[g.Key], Quantity: g.Sum(li => li.Quantity)))
    .ToArray();

var validation = plan
    .Select(p => p.Product.CanReserve(p.Quantity))
    .Append(order.CanSubmit())
    .SequenceAll();
if (validation.Error is { } err)
    return Result.Fail<Order>(err);

foreach (var (product, quantity) in plan)
    product.Reserve(quantity).Discard();

return order.Submit();
```

**Partial-Failure Atomicity test (the test the bug-shipping models never wrote).**

Every two-pass handler needs a test where a *later* element of the collection is unsatisfiable while *earlier* elements are. Happy-path tests cannot reveal the partial-mutation bug.

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Submit_with_one_unsatisfiable_line_does_not_reserve_any_stock()
{
    // Two line items; line 2 cannot be reserved (stock=0).
    var (order, productA, productB) = SeedOrderWithTwoLineItemsAsync(
        stockA: 10, qtyA: 3,   // line 1 satisfiable
        stockB: 0,  qtyB: 1);  // line 2 unsatisfiable
    var aStockBefore = productA.Stock;
    var bStockBefore = productB.Stock;

    var r = await _sender.Send(new SubmitOrderCommand(order.Id), cancellationToken);

    r.Should().BeFailureOfType<Error.InvalidInput>();
    productA.Stock.Should().Be(aStockBefore);   // NOT partially reserved
    productB.Stock.Should().Be(bStockBefore);
    order.IsSubmitted.Should().BeFalse();        // primary aggregate not transitioned
}
```

Together with the duplicate-product case (two lines for the same product whose summed quantity exceeds available stock), these are the two failure-mode tests that catch every form of this bug.

## Recipe 26 — Test a `BackgroundService` with `WorkerHarness<TWorker>`

**Problem.** A periodic worker reads pending work, dispatches a side effect, and emits a domain event per item. Integration tests must drive the worker forward deterministically (no `Task.Delay`), capture the domain events the worker raised, and stop the host cleanly — without re-implementing the `IHost` + `FakeTimeProvider` + `IActorProvider` + `IDomainEventHandler<T>` plumbing in every test fixture.

```csharp
// The worker under test. BackgroundService is registered as a singleton hosted service,
// so it resolves scoped services through an IServiceScopeFactory rather than capturing
// them in the constructor. IWorkerTickSignal is the harness-only observation primitive;
// production hosts do not register an implementation, so the worker injects it as an
// optional dependency and no-ops when absent.
public sealed class HealthProbeWorker(
    IServiceScopeFactory scopeFactory,
    TimeProvider time,
    IWorkerTickSignal? tick = null) : BackgroundService
{
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        // Register the first Task.Delay BEFORE signaling readiness — the signal must
        // prove the FakeTimeProvider callback exists. Task.Delay(TimeSpan, TimeProvider,
        // CancellationToken) eagerly registers the timer with the TimeProvider when
        // called, so by the time SignalAsync("ready") completes the callback is already
        // observable to Time.Advance. Signaling FIRST (before Task.Delay) would leave a
        // gap during which the test can resume from WaitForTickAsync("ready"), call
        // Time.Advance, and have the worker subsequently register a deadline of
        // (advanced-now + period) — losing the Advance. The signal is a no-op in
        // production hosts that do not register IWorkerTickSignal.
        var nextDelay = Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), time, stoppingToken);
        if (tick is not null)
            await tick.SignalAsync("ready", stoppingToken).ConfigureAwait(false);

        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            try { await nextDelay.ConfigureAwait(false); }
            catch (OperationCanceledException) { return; }

            await using var scope = scopeFactory.CreateAsyncScope();
            var mediator  = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IMediator>();
            var publisher = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDomainEventPublisher>();
            var repo      = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IHealthProbeRepository>();

            foreach (var probe in await repo.GetDuePendingAsync(stoppingToken).ConfigureAwait(false))
            {
                var outcome = await mediator.Send(new RunProbeCommand(probe.Id), stoppingToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
                if (outcome.IsSuccess)
                    await publisher.PublishAsync(
                        new ProbeCompletedDomainEvent(probe.Id, time.GetUtcNow()),
                        stoppingToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
            }

            // Register the next iteration's delay BEFORE signaling "probe", for the same
            // reason as above: a test that snapshots a probe cursor and advances time
            // after the wait expects the next callback to already be registered.
            // Signaling AFTER PublishAsync + the next Task.Delay registration makes
            // WaitForTickAsync a true completion barrier — every captured event for this
            // iteration is recorded AND the next callback exists for the next Advance.
            nextDelay = Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), time, stoppingToken);
            if (tick is not null)
                await tick.SignalAsync("probe", stoppingToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
}

public class HealthProbeWorkerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Worker_dispatches_due_probes_and_publishes_a_completion_event_per_run()

        {
            opts.ConfigureServices(s =>
            {
                // WorkerHarness deliberately does not call AddMediator(...) or
                // AddDomainEventDispatch(); a worker test re-uses the production
                // composition root so the test exercises the same wiring the production
                // host uses. Forgetting either registration would surface as
                // GetRequiredService throwing at scope resolution.
                s.AddMediator(options => options.Assemblies = [typeof(RunProbeCommand).Assembly]);
                s.AddDomainEventDispatch();
                s.AddSingleton<IHealthProbeRepository, FakeHealthProbeRepository>();
            });
            opts.SeedAsync(async (sp, ct) =>
            {
                var repo = sp.GetRequiredService<IHealthProbeRepository>();
                await repo.AddAsync(new HealthProbe(ProbeId.New(), "/api/orders"), ct);
            });
        });

        await harness.StartAsync(TestContext.Current.CancellationToken);

        // StartAsync returns as soon as ExecuteAsync is scheduled, NOT after the
        // worker has registered its first Task.Delay callback with FakeTimeProvider.
        // Block on the worker's "ready" signal — which the worker emits AFTER its
        // first Task.Delay(...) call (so the callback is provably registered before
        // the signal fires) — so the subsequent Time.Advance always lands on an
        // existing callback. Without this barrier the Advance races the worker.
        await harness.WaitForTickAsync("ready", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

        // Snapshot the most recent "probe" tick BEFORE advancing time. The cursor is the
        // global signal index (LastTickIndexOf returns -1 when nothing has signaled yet);
        // WaitForTickAsync(after: cursor, ...) will block until a tick with a STRICTLY
        // greater global index fires, so the wait can never observe a tick already in
        // the recorded history. Do not use TickCountOf as a cursor — it is a per-name
        // count, not the global signal index, and will race when other tick names
        // interleave.
        var cursor = harness.LastTickIndexOf("probe");

        // Advance the FakeTimeProvider past the worker's 5-minute Task.Delay. Advance is
        // deterministic; the worker's Task.Delay(interval, time, ct) resumes and runs the
        // iteration. WaitForTickAsync's timeout measures real time and is NOT consumed
        // by the call to Advance.
        harness.Time.Advance(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
        await harness.WaitForTickAsync("probe", after: cursor, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));

        // Once WaitForTickAsync returns, PublishAsync for this iteration has already
        // returned (the worker signals AFTER the publish loop), so the captured-event
        // list is fully populated and the synchronous read is race-free.
        harness.Events<ProbeCompletedDomainEvent>().Should().HaveCount(1);
    }
}
```

**What it shows.** `WorkerHarness<TWorker>.CreateAsync(...)` builds an `IHost` with `TWorker` registered as the sole hosted service, wires `TimeProvider` to `FakeTimeProvider`, registers a `TestActorProvider` returning `WorkerHarnessOptions.SystemActor`, and installs an open-generic `IDomainEventHandler<>` that captures every published event for `harness.Events<TEvent>()` and `harness.WaitForEventAsync<TEvent>()`. The harness does **not** register `AddMediator(...)` or `AddDomainEventDispatch()` — those are part of the production composition root and belong in the test's `ConfigureServices` callback so the worker exercises the same wiring it uses in production. `harness.StartAsync(...)` returns as soon as `ExecuteAsync` is scheduled on the thread pool, NOT after the worker has registered its first `Task.Delay` with `FakeTimeProvider`; the recipe makes the readiness barrier deterministic by REGISTERING the first `Task.Delay(...)` before signaling `"ready"` (because `Task.Delay(TimeSpan, TimeProvider, CancellationToken)` eagerly calls `timeProvider.CreateTimer(...)`, the callback exists by the time `SignalAsync("ready")` completes), then `await harness.WaitForTickAsync("ready", ...)` in the test releases when the test can safely call `Time.Advance`. Signaling first and registering the delay second would leave a gap during which the test could `Advance` before any callback was registered — losing the `Advance`. The lazier alternative when you cannot change the worker is `await harness.SettleAsync()`, at the cost of a real-time yield. `harness.Time.Advance(...)` is the deterministic equivalent of `Task.Delay` — the worker's `Task.Delay(interval, time, ct)` resumes synchronously and runs the next iteration. Tests should pair `Advance` with `WaitForTickAsync(name, after: cursor, ...)` so the wait observes the *next* tick rather than racing with one already in the history; `LastTickIndexOf(name)` is the right baseline-cursor source. The harness's `DisposeAsync` stops the host with a real-time cap; if `StartAsync` itself throws, the harness drives a best-effort `StopAsync` so any earlier-registered `IHostedService` that succeeded still observes its stop hook.

`Trellis.Testing.Worker` references `Trellis.Testing` transitively, so handler-test assertions like `Should().BeSuccess()` and `FakeRepository<,>` are available from the same test project without an extra package.

## Recipe 27 — Idempotent inserts on a unique constraint with `TryInsertUniqueAsync`

**Problem.** A worker (or any caller) processes events that may be redelivered. It must record "I handled event X for destination Y" exactly once. A `(EventId, DestinationId)` unique index in the database is the source of truth — the second delivery should silently no-op, not crash, not double-process. Doing this with `Any(...)` + `Add` + `SaveChangesAsync` is a TOCTOU race: two concurrent deliveries both see "not present", both `Add`, one wins and the loser throws `DbUpdateException`. Catching `DbUpdateException` and string-matching on the inner exception's message is provider-specific (SQL Server says one thing, PostgreSQL another, SQLite a third) and easy to get subtly wrong.

**Solution.** `DbContext.TryInsertUniqueAsync(entity, ct)` (from `Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContextIdempotencyExtensions`) adds the entity, calls `SaveChangesAsync`, and converts a provider-level unique-constraint violation into `Result.Fail(new Error.Conflict(null, "duplicate.key"))` with a generic safe `Detail`. Constraint identity (`ConstraintName`, `ConstraintTableName`) is extracted on a best-effort basis and attached to the `Error.Conflict` payload for structured logging. All other failures — concurrency, foreign-key, cancellation, connection errors — propagate to the caller so retry policies and global handlers see them. The helper requires a clean `DbContext` (no pending changes) so a duplicate-key violation can be unambiguously attributed to the entity being inserted.

```csharp
// Domain: a worker records each (EventId, DestinationId) it has dispatched.
public sealed class DispatchedDelivery
{
    public required Guid EventId { get; init; }
    public required Guid DestinationId { get; init; }
    public required DateTimeOffset DispatchedAt { get; init; }
}

// EF Core: composite primary key on (EventId, DestinationId) gives the unique
// constraint TryInsertUniqueAsync relies on; no separate HasIndex().IsUnique()
// is needed. If your model already has a surrogate PK, add the unique index
// explicitly instead: e.HasIndex(d => new { d.EventId, d.DestinationId }).IsUnique().
public sealed class DispatchLogDbContext(DbContextOptions<DispatchLogDbContext> options) : DbContext(options)
{
    public DbSet<DispatchedDelivery> Deliveries => Set<DispatchedDelivery>();

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<DispatchedDelivery>()
            .HasKey(d => new { d.EventId, d.DestinationId });
    }
}

public sealed class DispatchLogger(DispatchLogDbContext db, TimeProvider time, ILogger<DispatchLogger> log)
{
    public async Task<Result<DeliveryOutcome>> RecordDeliveryAsync(
        Guid eventId, Guid destinationId, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var entry = new DispatchedDelivery
        {
            EventId = eventId,
            DestinationId = destinationId,
            DispatchedAt = time.GetUtcNow(),
        };

        var result = await db.TryInsertUniqueAsync(entry, ct);

        if (result.IsSuccess)
            return Result.Ok(DeliveryOutcome.Recorded);

        if (result.UnwrapError() is Error.Conflict conflict && conflict.ReasonCode == "duplicate.key")
        {
            // The second delivery — exactly what idempotency promises. No-op, do not fail.
            log.LogInformation(
                "Duplicate delivery suppressed for event {EventId} / destination {DestinationId} (table {Table}, constraint {Constraint}).",
                eventId, destinationId, conflict.ConstraintTableName, conflict.ConstraintName);
            return Result.Ok(DeliveryOutcome.AlreadyRecorded);
        }

        return Result.Fail<DeliveryOutcome>(result.UnwrapError());
    }
}

public enum DeliveryOutcome { Recorded, AlreadyRecorded }
```

**What it shows.** `TryInsertUniqueAsync` is the framework idiom for "insert unless a unique constraint says it already exists". The success path returns `Result.Ok(entity)` and the entity has its EF-populated generated values (PK, row version, sequence-assigned columns) in place on the same instance the caller passed in. The duplicate path returns `Result.Fail<TEntity>(Error.Conflict { ReasonCode = "duplicate.key", ConstraintName, ConstraintTableName })` and the helper detaches the attempted entity from the change tracker so a retry with a freshly-constructed entity does not re-flush the original on the next `SaveChangesAsync`. `ConstraintName` and `ConstraintTableName` are best-effort and marked `[JsonIgnore]` on `Error.Conflict` — they are telemetry fields for structured logs, never serialized to API responses; the safe-for-clients message lives in `Detail`. Foreign-key violations, `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`, connection-level exceptions, and `OperationCanceledException` all propagate normally so retry policies still see them. The clean-context precondition (throws `InvalidOperationException` if `ChangeTracker.HasChanges()` is `true` on entry) prevents the failure from being mis-attributed to the inserted entity when unrelated pending changes exist; flush them first or use a fresh context. Pair the helper with `SaveChangesWithRetryAsync` (from `Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContextRetryExtensions`) when the retry shape is "regenerate a key and try again" rather than "second writer wins" — the two helpers are complementary, not substitutes.

`DbExceptionClassifier.ExtractConstraintIdentity(DbUpdateException)` is the lower-level building block the helper uses; the same identity is also now populated on the `Error.Conflict` returned by `SaveChangesResultAsync` and `SaveChangesWithRetryAsync` for the `duplicate.key` and `referential.integrity` reason codes, so existing code paths get the new telemetry fields for free.
