# Trellis.Authorization — API Reference

**Package:** `Trellis.Authorization`
**Namespace:** `Trellis.Authorization`
**Purpose:** Domain-layer authorization primitives — actor identity / permission / attribute model and the contracts used by the mediator's authorization behavior to perform static (permission) and resource-based authorization. This package contains no ASP.NET Core dependencies; the `IActorProvider` implementations and DI helpers ship in `Trellis.Asp` (see [`trellis-api-asp.md`](trellis-api-asp.md), namespace `Trellis.Asp.Authorization`).

> [!TIP]
> For the end-to-end mental model — JWT → JwtBearer → `IActorProvider` → mediator behaviors → 401/403 — plus decision trees and Mermaid diagrams, read [Mental model](../articles/integration-asp-authorization.md#mental-model) in the integration article first. This file is the type-by-type reference.

See also: [trellis-api-cookbook.md](trellis-api-cookbook.md) — recipes using this package.

## Use this file when

- You are modeling actors, permissions, forbidden permissions, or actor attributes without ASP.NET dependencies.
- You are implementing static permission authorization through `IAuthorize`.
- You are implementing resource-based authorization through `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` and want the canonical guard shape.

## Patterns Index

| Goal | Canonical API / pattern | See |
|---|---|---|
| Represent the current user/service | `Actor` | [`Actor`](#actor) |
| Check granted permissions with explicit deny override | `actor.HasPermission(...)`, `HasAllPermissions(...)`, `HasAnyPermission(...)` | [`Actor`](#actor) |
| Resolve actor for a request/message | `IActorProvider.GetCurrentActorAsync(...)` | [`IActorProvider`](#iactorprovider) |
| Require static permissions on a message | Implement `IAuthorize.RequiredPermissions` | [`IAuthorize`](#iauthorize) |
| Authorize against a loaded resource | Implement `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>.Authorize(actor, resource)` | [`IAuthorizeResource<TResource>`](#iauthorizeresourcetresource) |
| Write owner/admin resource guards | `Result.Ensure(condition, new Error.Forbidden(...))` | [`IAuthorizeResource<TResource>`](#iauthorizeresourcetresource), [Core `Result.Ensure`](trellis-api-core.md#public-static-partial-class-result) |
| Identify a resource by id for shared loading | `IIdentifyResource<TResource, TId>` | [`IIdentifyResource<TResource, TId>`](#iidentifyresourcetresource-tid) |
| Authorize against a related resource one or more navigation hops away (cricket-style fan-out, owner chains) | Implement `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>` on the command + `IIdentifyRelatedResource<TRelated, TId>` (singular) or `IIdentifyRelatedResources<TRelated, TId>` (terminal plural) on entities along the path | [`IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>`](#iauthorizeresourceviatowner), [`IIdentifyRelatedResource<TRelated, TId>`](#iidentifyrelatedresourcetrelated-tid), [`IIdentifyRelatedResources<TRelated, TId>`](#iidentifyrelatedresourcestrelated-tid) |

## Common traps

- `Trellis.Authorization` is domain/application-layer only. ASP.NET actor providers are documented in [trellis-api-asp.md](trellis-api-asp.md#namespace-trellisaspauthorization).
- Prefer `Result.Ensure` for boolean authorization guards so generated code uses the same ROP primitive as the rest of Trellis.
- Do not mutate `RequiredPermissions`; expose the complete permission list as an immutable/read-only collection.
- The DI registration extension `AddResourceAuthorization(...)` lives in `Trellis.Mediator` (`namespace Trellis.Mediator`), not in `Trellis.Authorization`. Wiring an `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` therefore typically requires both `using Trellis.Authorization;` (for the interfaces) and `using Trellis.Mediator;` (for the DI extension). The compile error if the second is missing is `CS1061: 'IServiceCollection' does not contain a definition for 'AddResourceAuthorization' and no accessible extension method 'AddResourceAuthorization' accepting a first argument of type 'IServiceCollection' could be found` — see [trellis-api-mediator.md](trellis-api-mediator.md#servicecollectionextensions).

## Types

### Namespace `Trellis.Authorization`

### `Actor`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public sealed class Actor : IEquatable<Actor>
```

`Actor` is an authorization-layer **entity**. Equality / `GetHashCode` / `==` / `!=` are based on the `Id` property only — two `Actor` instances with the same `Id` represent the same principal even when their `Permissions`, `ForbiddenPermissions`, or `Attributes` differ (those are point-in-time state about the principal, not part of identity). Mirrors `Trellis.Entity<TId>` semantics without inheriting the full `IAggregate` surface.

**Constructors**

| Signature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `public Actor(ActorId id, IReadOnlySet<string> permissions, IReadOnlySet<string> forbiddenPermissions, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> attributes)` | Typed constructor. Snapshots the supplied state into frozen collections (ordinal comparison). Throws `ArgumentNullException` when any argument is null. |
| `public Actor(string id, IReadOnlySet<string> permissions, IReadOnlySet<string> forbiddenPermissions, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> attributes)` | Convenience overload that wraps the raw claim string in `ActorId` (via `ActorId.Create`) and delegates to the typed constructor. Throws `ArgumentException` when `id` is null / empty / whitespace. |

**Fields**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PermissionScopeSeparator` | `const char` | Separator used between permission name and scope in scoped permission strings. Value: `':'`. |

**Properties**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Id` | `ActorId` | Strongly-typed principal identifier (e.g. JWT `sub`). Wraps the raw claim string in a [`RequiredString<ActorId>`](trellis-api-core.md) so the identity flows through authorization-layer APIs and consumer aggregate fields as a domain type rather than an untyped `string`. |
| `Permissions` | `IReadOnlySet<string>` | Granted permissions. Ordinal comparison; setter snapshots into a `FrozenSet<string>`. |
| `ForbiddenPermissions` | `IReadOnlySet<string>` | Explicit deny-list. Deny always overrides allow. Snapshotted into a `FrozenSet<string>`. |
| `Attributes` | `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>` | ABAC attributes. Snapshotted into a `FrozenDictionary<string, string>` with ordinal comparer. |

**Methods**

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public static Actor Create(ActorId id, IReadOnlySet<string> permissions)` | `Actor` | Typed factory. Creates an actor with empty `ForbiddenPermissions` and empty `Attributes`. Throws `ArgumentNullException` for null arguments. |
| `public static Actor Create(string id, IReadOnlySet<string> permissions)` | `Actor` | Convenience factory that wraps the raw claim string in `ActorId`. |
| `public bool HasPermission(string permission)` | `bool` | Returns `true` only when `permission` is in `Permissions` and not in `ForbiddenPermissions`. |
| `public bool HasPermission(string permission, string scope)` | `bool` | Checks the scoped permission composed as `permission` + `':'` + `scope` (deny-aware). Throws `ArgumentNullException` when either argument is null. |
| `public bool HasAllPermissions(IEnumerable<string> permissions)` | `bool` | `true` when every entry passes `HasPermission`. |
| `public bool HasAnyPermission(IEnumerable<string> permissions)` | `bool` | `true` when at least one entry passes `HasPermission`. |
| `public bool IsOwner(ActorId resourceOwnerId)` | `bool` | Typed equality check between `Id` and `resourceOwnerId` using `ActorId`'s value-equality semantics. Prefer this overload when the owner id is itself a typed `ActorId` so the comparison is type-checked at the call site. |
| `public bool IsOwner(string resourceOwnerId)` | `bool` | Convenience overload that compares `Id.Value` and `resourceOwnerId` with `StringComparison.Ordinal`. |
| `public bool HasAttribute(string key)` | `bool` | `true` when `Attributes` contains `key`. |
| `public string? GetAttribute(string key)` | `string?` | Returns the attribute value or `null` when absent. |

### `ActorId`

**Declaration**

```csharp
[Trim, NotDefault]
public sealed partial class ActorId : RequiredString<ActorId>;
```

Strongly-typed wrapper around the raw principal id (typically the JWT `sub` or AAD `oid` claim) so the authorization layer exposes a domain type instead of an untyped `string`. Decorated with `[Trim, NotDefault]`: the value is trimmed on construction and an empty / whitespace-only id is rejected. Generated factories `ActorId.Create(string)` / `ActorId.TryCreate(string?)` come from the bundled source generator (see [`trellis-api-core.md`](trellis-api-core.md)).

Consumers that store the principal id at aggregate boundaries — audit-style fields like `Order.CreatedByActorId` or `Document.LastModifiedByActorId` — should reuse `ActorId` for those fields so cross-aggregate comparisons (`actor.IsOwner(order.CreatedByActorId)`) are type-checked end-to-end. Domain identifiers that are conceptually different from the principal id (a customer aggregate id, a tenant member id, a domain user aggregate's primary key) remain whatever VO the domain models and are resolved to / from the principal at the application service boundary.

### `ActorAttributes`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public static class ActorAttributes
```

Well-known string keys for `Actor.Attributes`. Claim-derived keys align with Azure Entra ID v2.0 access tokens.

**Fields**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TenantId` | `const string` | Entra `tid` claim — issuing tenant GUID. Value: `"tid"`. |
| `PreferredUsername` | `const string` | Entra `preferred_username` claim. Value: `"preferred_username"`. |
| `AuthorizedParty` | `const string` | Entra `azp` claim — application ID of the calling client. Value: `"azp"`. |
| `AuthorizedPartyAcr` | `const string` | Entra `azpacr` claim — client authentication strength (`0` public, `1` secret, `2` certificate). Value: `"azpacr"`. |
| `AuthContextClassReference` | `const string` | Entra `acrs` claim — Conditional Access auth-context references. Value: `"acrs"`. |
| `IpAddress` | `const string` | Request IP address, populated from `HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress`. Value: `"ip_address"`. |
| `MfaAuthenticated` | `const string` | Whether the actor authenticated with MFA — derived from the `amr` claim. Value: `"mfa"`. |

### `IActorProvider`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IActorProvider
```

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Task<Maybe<Actor>> GetCurrentActorAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` | `Task<Maybe<Actor>>` | Returns the current authenticated actor wrapped in `Maybe.From(...)`, or `Maybe<Actor>.None` when the request has no usable authenticated actor. The mediator authorization pipeline maps `Maybe.None` to `Error.Unauthorized` (HTTP 401) per RFC 9110 §15.5.2. Implementations should throw `InvalidOperationException` only for genuine infrastructure or configuration failures (no `HttpContext`, mapping delegate threw, etc.) — those still surface as `Error.InternalServerError` (HTTP 500). "No actor" is client-error state, not an exception. Register as scoped. |

**401 vs 500 contract.** `Maybe<Actor>.None` means the framework cannot identify an actor for the request — typically the request lacks credentials, the auth middleware did not produce an authenticated identity, or the configured actor-id claim is missing from an otherwise authenticated identity. All three are classes of client error and the mediator pipeline emits HTTP 401. A thrown `InvalidOperationException` means the provider itself cannot operate (no `HttpContext`, malformed configuration, mapping delegate failure) — that's a server bug and surfaces as HTTP 500.

> **`WWW-Authenticate` header on the 401.** RFC 9110 §11.6.1 requires `WWW-Authenticate` on 401 responses. `ResponseFailureWriter` (the mediator → HTTP failure path) synthesizes a scheme-only challenge from the registered default-challenge scheme via `IAuthenticationSchemeProvider` when `Error.Unauthorized.Challenges` is empty and no other middleware has already written the header. Consumers who want a parametrized challenge (with `realm`, `scope`, `error`, `error_description`, etc.) populate `Error.Unauthorized.Challenges` explicitly — the writer treats supplied challenges as authoritative and never synthesizes over them. The synthesized header uses the scheme NAME registered with `AddAuthentication` (so `AddJwtBearer("ApiJwt", ...)` produces `WWW-Authenticate: ApiJwt`); services that need a different wire token populate `Challenges` themselves. If no authentication is registered at all, the writer emits no synthesized header — synthesizing "Bearer" for a service that does not use Bearer would mislead clients.

### `IAuthorize`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IAuthorize
```

Marker for commands/queries enforcing static (permission-only) authorization. The mediator's `AuthorizationBehavior<TMessage, TResponse>` requires the current actor to hold **all** listed permissions (AND semantics).

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RequiredPermissions` | `IReadOnlyList<string>` | Permissions every caller must hold. Duplicates and order are ignored — the check is set-like under AND-semantics. |

### `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IAuthorizeResource<in TResource>
```

Implemented by a command/query to perform resource-based authorization once the resource has been loaded.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IResult Authorize(Actor actor, TResource resource)` | `IResult` | Returns success to proceed or a failure (typically `Error.Forbidden`) to short-circuit the pipeline. |

### `IIdentifyResource<TResource, TId>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IIdentifyResource<TResource, out TId>
```

Companion to `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` that exposes a typed resource identifier so the pipeline can use a `SharedResourceLoaderById<TResource, TId>` instead of a per-command loader.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TId GetResourceId()` | `TId` | Extracts the typed resource ID from the message. |

### `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>
```

Declares resource-based authorization against a resource that is **not** the leaf the command identifies, but is reachable via one or more `IIdentifyRelatedResource[s]<,>` declarations on entities along the navigation chain. The originating motivation is the cricket-style "actor owns Team1 OR Team2" pattern: command identifies a `Match`, authorization is evaluated against the set of teams it points at.

The pipeline always passes `IReadOnlyList<TOwner>` to `Authorize` — size 1 for chains terminating in a singular hop, size N for chains terminating in a plural hop (cricket fan-out). The framework does not impose the operator over the list; the command picks `Any`, `All`, or any other shape inside `Authorize`.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IResult Authorize(Actor actor, IReadOnlyList<TOwner> owners)` | `IResult` | Returns success to proceed or a failure (typically `Error.Forbidden`) to short-circuit. The `owners` list is non-null and non-empty; an empty plural navigation short-circuits to `Error.Forbidden` before `Authorize` is called. |

**Failure semantics**:

- **Leaf load failure** — the loader's error bubbles verbatim (matches existing `IAuthorizeResource<T>` semantics for the resource the command identifies).
- **Intermediate or owner load failure** — collapsed to `Error.Forbidden` to avoid leaking existence of related resources whose presence/absence the actor may not be authorized to learn.
- **Empty result at any hop** (singular extract returning 0 IDs or plural extract returning 0 IDs) — short-circuits to `Error.Forbidden` without invoking `Authorize`.
- **Missing `SharedResourceLoaderById<TTo, TToId>`** at any hop — throws `InvalidOperationException` (deployment bug, not authorization denial).

A command may implement either `IAuthorizeResource<T>` **or** `IAuthorizeResourceVia<TOwner>`, never both. Registration throws at startup if both are present — security primitives are not silently composed.

### `IIdentifyRelatedResource<TRelated, TId>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IIdentifyRelatedResource<TRelated, out TId>
```

Entity-side declaration of a single outbound foreign-key navigation. Used by the resolver to walk the navigation chain at registration time. Implement on aggregate roots whose authorization is evaluated against a different aggregate one or more hops away.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TId GetRelatedResourceId()` | `TId` | Returns the identifier of the related resource of type `TRelated`. |

For two distinct outbound navigations to the same `TRelated` (cricket `Match.HomeTeamId` / `Match.AwayTeamId`), use [`IIdentifyRelatedResources<TRelated, TId>`](#iidentifyrelatedresourcestrelated-tid) instead — C# disallows declaring the same generic interface twice on a single type.

### `IIdentifyRelatedResources<TRelated, TId>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IIdentifyRelatedResources<TRelated, TId>
```

Entity-side declaration of a plural outbound navigation (fan-out). Used at the **terminal** hop of an authorization chain to express OR-style / candidate-set authorization (cricket `Match → {HomeTeam, AwayTeam}`).

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IReadOnlyList<TId> GetRelatedResourceIds()` | `IReadOnlyList<TId>` | Returns the identifiers of all related resources of type `TRelated`. Non-null. Duplicates are de-duplicated by the pipeline before loading; an empty list short-circuits to `Error.Forbidden`. Order is not significant. |

Plural-in-middle (fan-out cartesian expansion) is intentionally out of scope for v1 and rejected at registration time. For chains needing a plural intermediate hop, drop to `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TProjection>` with a projection type.

### `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TResource>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public interface IResourceLoader<in TMessage, TResource>
```

Loads the resource required for resource-based authorization. Resolved per request from DI as scoped.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Task<Result<TResource>> LoadAsync(TMessage message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)` | `Task<Result<TResource>>` | Returns the loaded resource or a failure (typically `Error.NotFound`). The pipeline short-circuits on failure before invoking `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>.Authorize`. |

### `ResourceLoaderById<TMessage, TResource, TId>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public abstract class ResourceLoaderById<TMessage, TResource, TId> : IResourceLoader<TMessage, TResource>
```

Convenience base for loaders that extract an ID from the message and call a repository.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protected abstract TId GetId(TMessage message)` | `TId` | Extract the resource ID from the message. |
| `protected abstract Task<Result<TResource>> GetByIdAsync(TId id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)` | `Task<Result<TResource>>` | Fetch the resource by ID; return `Result.Fail` with `Error.NotFound` when missing. |
| `public Task<Result<TResource>> LoadAsync(TMessage message, CancellationToken cancellationToken)` | `Task<Result<TResource>>` | Sealed glue: calls `GetId(message)` then `GetByIdAsync(...)`. |

### `SharedResourceLoaderById<TResource, TId>`

**Declaration**

```csharp
public abstract class SharedResourceLoaderById<TResource, TId>
```

A single loader shared across every command that authorizes against the same `TResource`. When a command implements both `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` and `IIdentifyResource<TResource, TId>` the pipeline bridges to this shared loader automatically. Explicit `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TResource>` registrations win over the shared loader.

`Trellis.Mediator.ServiceCollectionExtensions.AddResourceAuthorization(...)` registers all concrete `SharedResourceLoaderById<TResource, TId>` implementations as **scoped** — safe to depend on a `DbContext` or other scoped repository. Replace the registration after the scan completes if a different lifetime is required.

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public abstract Task<Result<TResource>> GetByIdAsync(TId id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)` | `Task<Result<TResource>>` | Load the resource by ID; return `Result.Fail` with `Error.NotFound` when missing. |

## Behavioral notes

- **Deny overrides allow.** A permission listed in both `Permissions` and `ForbiddenPermissions` is denied. `HasPermission`, `HasAllPermissions`, `HasAnyPermission`, and `HasPermission(permission, scope)` all observe this rule.
- **Ordinal comparison everywhere.** Permission lookups, attribute lookups, and `IsOwner` use `StringComparison.Ordinal`. Hydrate permissions and attributes with consistent casing.
- **Permissions snapshot to frozen collections.** Mutating a collection passed into `Actor` after construction has no effect; the actor exposes a `FrozenSet<string>` / `FrozenDictionary<string, string>` snapshot for O(1) lookups.
- **Scoped permissions** use the `"Permission:Scope"` convention (`Document.Edit:Tenant_A`). Add scoped entries directly to `Permissions` and check via `HasPermission(string, string)` — no separate scope collection.
- **Pipeline ordering.** When a command implements both `IAuthorize` (static) and `IAuthorizeResource<TResource>` (resource), the mediator behavior runs static checks first; resource loading and `Authorize(actor, resource)` only execute if the static check passes. A loader failure short-circuits before `Authorize` is called.

## Code examples

### Static permission authorization

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Authorization;

public sealed partial class OrderId : RequiredGuid<OrderId>;

public sealed record DeleteOrderCommand(OrderId OrderId) : ICommand<Result<Unit>>, IAuthorize
{
    public IReadOnlyList<string> RequiredPermissions { get; } = ["orders:delete"];
}
```

### Resource-based authorization with a shared loader

> **Preferred in generated services.** Use `IIdentifyResource<TResource, TId>` + `SharedResourceLoaderById<TResource, TId>` for resource authorization. A per-command `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TResource>` is an escape hatch for request-scoped state or command-specific load logic.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Authorization;

public sealed partial class OrderId : RequiredGuid<OrderId>;
public sealed partial class ActorId : RequiredString<ActorId>;

public sealed record Order(OrderId Id, ActorId OwnerId);

public sealed record CancelOrderCommand(OrderId OrderId)
    : ICommand<Result<Unit>>, IAuthorizeResource<Order>, IIdentifyResource<Order, OrderId>
{
    public OrderId GetResourceId() => OrderId;

    public IResult Authorize(Actor actor, Order order) =>
        Result.Ensure(
            order.OwnerId.Value == actor.Id || actor.HasPermission("orders:cancel-any"),
            new Error.Forbidden("orders.cancel")
                { Detail = "Only the owner can cancel this order." });
}

public interface IOrderRepository
{
    Task<Maybe<Order>> GetByIdAsync(OrderId id, CancellationToken ct);
}

public sealed class OrderResourceLoader(IOrderRepository repo)
    : SharedResourceLoaderById<Order, OrderId>
{
    public override async Task<Result<Order>> GetByIdAsync(OrderId id, CancellationToken ct) =>
        (await repo.GetByIdAsync(id, ct)).ToResult(new Error.NotFound(ResourceRef.For<Order>(id)));
}
```

### Indirect (multi-hop) resource authorization — cricket fan-out

Authorize a `UploadScorecardCommand` against the actor owning **either** the home or away team of the match. The command identifies the leaf (`Match`); `Match` declares its plural outbound navigation to `Team`; the command's `Authorize` runs against the loaded list.

```csharp
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Authorization;

public sealed partial class MatchId : RequiredGuid<MatchId>;
public sealed partial class TeamId : RequiredGuid<TeamId>;

public sealed class Match : Aggregate<MatchId>, IIdentifyRelatedResources<Team, TeamId>
{
    public TeamId HomeTeamId { get; }
    public TeamId AwayTeamId { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<TeamId> GetRelatedResourceIds() => [HomeTeamId, AwayTeamId];
}

public sealed class Team : Aggregate<TeamId>
{
    public string CreatedByActorId { get; }
}

public sealed record UploadScorecardCommand(MatchId MatchId, /* fields */)
    : ICommand<Result<Unit>>,
      IAuthorizeResourceVia<Team>,
      IIdentifyResource<Match, MatchId>
{
    public MatchId GetResourceId() => MatchId;

    public IResult Authorize(Actor actor, IReadOnlyList<Team> owners) =>
        Result.Ensure(
            owners.Any(t => t.CreatedByActorId == actor.Id),
            new Error.Forbidden("match.upload-scorecard")
                { Detail = "Actor does not own either match team." });
}

// Composition root: assembly scan registers the via-behavior, the leaf-loader bridge,
// and the SharedResourceLoaderById<Match,MatchId> + SharedResourceLoaderById<Team,TeamId>.
services.AddTrellisBehaviors();
services.AddResourceAuthorization(typeof(UploadScorecardCommand).Assembly);
```

For chains (e.g. `Match → Team → Tournament`), declare `IIdentifyRelatedResource<Team, TeamId>` on `Match` and `IIdentifyRelatedResource<Tournament, TournamentId>` on `Team`, then set `IAuthorizeResourceVia<Tournament>` on the command.

For shapes the navigation-chain model can't express (composite keys, conditional/data-dependent paths, recursive hierarchies, projections, joins, plural-in-middle), drop to an explicit `IResourceLoader<TMessage, TProjection>` returning a custom projection, and put `IAuthorizeResource<TProjection>` on the command.

### Constructing an `Actor` directly (tests, custom providers)

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Trellis.Authorization;

var actor = new Actor(
    id: "user-1",
    permissions: new HashSet<string>
    {
        "orders:cancel",
        $"orders:view{Actor.PermissionScopeSeparator}tenant-1",
    },
    forbiddenPermissions: new HashSet<string>(),
    attributes: new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        [ActorAttributes.TenantId] = "tenant-1",
        [ActorAttributes.MfaAuthenticated] = "true",
    });

bool canCancel = actor.HasPermission("orders:cancel");
bool canViewTenant = actor.HasPermission("orders:view", "tenant-1");
string? tenant = actor.GetAttribute(ActorAttributes.TenantId);
```
