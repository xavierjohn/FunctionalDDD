# Functional Programming with Domain-Driven Design

Functional programming, railway-oriented programming, and domain-driven design combine to create robust, reliable software.

**Functional programming** emphasizes pure functions—functions that take inputs and produce outputs without side effects. This leads to code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain. Learn more in the [Applying Functional Principles in C# Pluralsight course](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/ps-func).

**Railway-oriented programming** handles errors using a railway track metaphor. Code flows through operations that either succeed (continuing on the success track) or fail (switching to the error track). This makes error handling explicit and easier to reason about.

**Domain-driven design** focuses on understanding the problem domain and creating an accurate model to guide software design and implementation. This alignment with business needs creates software that better serves users.

These approaches complement each other: pure functions enable testable code, railway-oriented programming makes error handling explicit, and domain-driven design ensures alignment with business needs.
