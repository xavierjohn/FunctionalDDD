# Trellis analyzer rules

Trellis analyzers help you keep `Result<T>`, `Maybe<T>`, EF Core integration, and Trellis value objects on the happy path. Every rule below uses the **Trellis** analyzer category.

## Code fixes at a glance

These rules currently offer a code fix: **TRLS002**, **TRLS003**, **TRLS009**, and **TRLS015**.

## Suppressing a rule

Use `.editorconfig` when you want a project-wide or folder-wide setting:

```ini
dotnet_diagnostic.TRLS003.severity = none
```

Use `#pragma` when you need a narrow, local exception:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable TRLS003
var name = maybeName.Value;
#pragma warning restore TRLS003
```

> [!TIP]
> Treat analyzer suppressions as documentation. If a rule is intentionally suppressed, leave a short reason nearby.
