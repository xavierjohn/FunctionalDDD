# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Trellis

## Project overview

Trellis is an AI-native framework that helps create consistent, reliable enterprise software with railway-oriented programming, DDD primitives, ASP.NET integration, EF Core integration, and value objects.

These instructions are for repository workflow and contribution conventions only. They are not the source of truth for how to use Trellis APIs.

## API usage source of truth

Before writing or changing code that uses Trellis APIs, read the relevant files in `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/`.

Start with `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-cookbook.md`. Use its task lookup table to find the right recipe, then read the package reference files for exact signatures, overloads, namespaces, and examples. Do not infer Trellis API behavior from these Copilot instructions.

### Recommended context size

The full set of API references is ~548 KB (~137K tokens). The cookbook alone is ~92 KB (~23K tokens). Together with framework source needed for cross-checking, project source under edit, and accumulated tool output across a typical 30–50 turn session, the working set is **0.9–1.3 MB**.

| Tier | Context | When this is enough |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimum** | 200K | Narrow, single-file tasks. Forces a strict "load only the area-specific reference per task" discipline; cross-cutting work is error-prone at this tier. |
| **Recommended** | 400–500K | Most consumer projects. Lets the cookbook + 5–6 area-specific references stay resident through a PR-sized session. |
| **Comfortable** | 1M | Framework-internal work and greenfield projects with multiple integration points. Lets all 16 references stay resident from turn 1 without eviction. |

### Mandatory loads at session start

For any non-trivial Trellis work, load these **before** writing the first line of code or running the first sub-agent:

1. `trellis-api-cookbook.md` — always. Its task lookup table is the entry point.
2. `trellis-api-servicedefaults.md` — always. **Every** `services.AddXxx()` extension method in Trellis has a matching `TrellisServiceBuilder.UseXxx()` slot. Designing or modifying a registration helper without reading this file silently misses the builder slot.
3. The area-specific reference for the package being modified (from the table below).
4. The reference for **every package whose pipeline this work composes with**. Specifically: anything touching the Mediator pipeline must also load `trellis-api-efcore.md` (transactional behavior) and `trellis-api-authorization.md` (resource-authorization behavior); anything touching ASP must also load `trellis-api-mediator.md`.

| When touching... | Read first |
|---|---|
| Result, Maybe, Error, ROP operations, aggregates, entities, specifications | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-core.md` |
| Ready-to-use value objects and primitive attributes | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-primitives.md` |
| ASP.NET Core response mapping, validation, ETags, Prefer, range handling | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-asp.md` |
| EF Core integration | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-efcore.md` |
| Authorization | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-authorization.md` |
| FluentValidation integration | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-fluentvalidation.md` |
| HttpClient extensions | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-http.md` |
| Mediator pipeline behaviors | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-mediator.md` |
| State machine integration | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-statemachine.md` |
| Service defaults and composition root setup | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-servicedefaults.md` |
| Testing helpers | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-testing-reference.md` |
| ASP.NET Core integration-test helpers | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-testing-aspnetcore.md` |
| Analyzer rules and diagnostic IDs | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-anti-patterns.md` for ready-to-apply WRONG/FIX shapes, then `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-analyzers.md` for the formal spec |

### Preflight verification — required before generating non-trivial code

Reading the references is necessary but not sufficient. Before producing any non-trivial Trellis code, **explicitly answer these in your reasoning** (one or two lines is enough, but skipping the step is not allowed):

1. **Which task am I doing?** Name the task in the cookbook's task-lookup table — verbatim if possible.
2. **Which recipe applies?** Cite the recipe number (e.g. *"Recipe 1 — CRUD aggregate"* or *"Recipe 21 — Parallel independent loads"*). If no recipe applies, name the cookbook section or package reference that does.
3. **Which inherited surface does my type already get?** For any type derived from `Aggregate<TId>`, `Entity<TId>`, `RequiredGuid<T>`, `RequiredString<T>`, `RequiredEnum<T>`, the scalar `Required*<T>` primitives (`RequiredInt<T>`, `RequiredLong<T>`, `RequiredDecimal<T>`, `RequiredBool<T>`, `RequiredDateTime<T>`), `ValueObject`, or `ScalarValueObject<TSelf, T>`, list the inherited members you will *not* redeclare. Recipe 1 in the cookbook enumerates the standard set for `RequiredGuid<T>`, `RequiredString<T>`, `ValueObject`, and `Aggregate<TId>`; for `Entity<TId>`, `RequiredEnum<T>`, and the other scalar primitives, consult `trellis-api-primitives.md` and `trellis-api-core.md`. The most common Recipe 1 mistake is redeclaring `Id`, equality methods, or `TryCreate` that the base class already provides.
4. **Am I about to invent an API?** If you cannot point at a specific reference file + line range for the method/extension/attribute you are about to use, stop and load that reference. Do not synthesize the signature from prior knowledge.
5. **What does the analyzer say?** If the change is in a `Result`/`Maybe`/EF-Core/value-object pipeline, list which `TRLSxxx` IDs are relevant. Cite the matching section in `trellis-api-anti-patterns.md` if one exists; otherwise cite `trellis-api-analyzers.md` and the relevant package reference. Preserve the WRONG/FIX control-flow shape from the anti-pattern file, adapting identifiers, types, and error values to the caller — the snippets are pattern examples, not self-contained replacements.

If you cannot answer any of these, stop and load the missing reference before continuing.

### Adding a new public registration API (`AddXxx` / `UseXxx`)

When adding a new `services.AddTrellisXxx()` or `services.AddXxxDispatch()` style extension, the work is **not complete** until:

1. The matching `TrellisServiceBuilder.UseXxx(...)` slot is added in `Trellis.ServiceDefaults/src/TrellisServiceBuilder.cs`, with the call site placed correctly inside `Apply()` so canonical pipeline ordering is preserved.
2. The new helper is order-independent vs the other `AddTrellis*` extensions. If pipeline placement matters (e.g., the new behavior must wrap or be wrapped by `TransactionalCommandBehavior`), the registration must detect existing relevant behaviors and insert/yank-restore correctly — not just `TryAddEnumerable` and hope.
3. Both `trellis-api-mediator.md` (or the relevant area reference) **and** `trellis-api-servicedefaults.md` are updated. The two layers must stay in sync.
4. A test asserts the canonical pipeline order with the new registration both **before** and **after** `AddTrellisUnitOfWork<TContext>()` is called.

### Validating sub-agent findings

Sub-agents (rubber-duck, code-review) are recommendation engines, not ground truth. Before adopting a finding:

- Verify the claim against the relevant API reference, source code, or existing test. Most non-trivial findings are testable in 30 seconds.
- Push back on claims that contradict verified docs/source or existing intentional design. Reference earlier PRs (e.g., via `git log -S 'token'`) when the claim implies undoing prior work.
- Adopt findings that survive verification — and adopt them confidently, because verification means you understand the bug, not just the reviewer's claim about it.

If an API reference contradicts these instructions, treat the API reference as authoritative for API usage.

## Code style

- Omit braces for single-line `if`/`return` statements when consistent with nearby code.
- Use `char` overloads for single-character operations, for example `value.Contains('-')`.
- Use collection expressions in tests where appropriate, for example `.Should().Equal([1, 2, 3])`.
- Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library source code; do not add it in test code.
- Prefer `ValueTask<T>` for high-frequency operations that may complete synchronously; prefer `Task<T>` for I/O-bound work.
- Avoid broad `try`/`catch` blocks and silent fallbacks. Surface or propagate errors using the existing repository patterns documented in the API references.
- Keep public APIs documented with XML comments.

## Test-driven development

Follow TDD when fixing bugs or adding features:

1. Add or update a failing test that proves the bug or specifies the new behavior.
2. Implement the smallest correct change.
3. Refactor while keeping tests green.

Do not skip the red step for bug fixes or new behavior.

## Test organization

Tests are organized by source area:

| Area | Source | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| Core ROP and DDD | `Trellis.Core/src/` | `Trellis.Core/tests/` |
| Value objects | `Trellis.Primitives/src/` | `Trellis.Primitives/tests/` |
| Authorization | `Trellis.Authorization/src/` | `Trellis.Authorization/tests/` |
| Mediator | `Trellis.Mediator/src/` | `Trellis.Mediator/tests/` |
| ASP.NET Core | `Trellis.Asp/src/` | `Trellis.Asp/tests/` |
| HTTP | `Trellis.Http/src/` | `Trellis.Http/tests/` |
| EF Core | `Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore/src/` | `Trellis.EntityFrameworkCore/tests/` |
| State machine | `Trellis.StateMachine/src/` | `Trellis.StateMachine/tests/` |
| Testing helpers | `Trellis.Testing*/src/` | `Trellis.Testing*/tests/` |

Async extension tests use this file naming convention:

| Pattern | File name |
|---|---|
| Async receiver and async delegates | `[Method]Tests.[Type].cs` |
| Async receiver and sync delegates | `[Method]Tests.[Type].Left.cs` |
| Sync receiver and async delegates | `[Method]Tests.[Type].Right.cs` |

Test method names should follow `[Method]_[Variant]_[Scenario]_[Expectation]`.

For T4-generated tuple overloads, test the 2-tuple case comprehensively and validate larger tuple arities with minimal representative tests. Do not chase 100% coverage on generated tuple code.

## Documentation standards

When adding or changing public API surface, update the relevant API reference file in `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/`. Update package `README.md`, `NUGET_README.md`, DocFX articles, and `docs/docfx_project/docfx.json` metadata when those artifacts are directly affected.

Keep framework usage guidance in the API reference and cookbook files, not in this Copilot instruction file.

DocFX artifact checklist for package or public API changes:

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| DocFX metadata | `docs/docfx_project/docfx.json` |
| DocFX articles | `docs/docfx_project/articles/` |
| Article TOC | `docs/docfx_project/articles/toc.yml` |
| Package README | `Trellis.{Package}/README.md` |
| NuGet README | `Trellis.{Package}/NUGET_README.md` |
| AI API reference | `docs/docfx_project/api_reference/trellis-api-{library}.md` |

## File encoding and PowerShell

All repository files must be UTF-8 with BOM.

When using PowerShell for file writes, preserve the BOM:

```powershell
$utf8Bom = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $true
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, $utf8Bom)
```

Avoid `Set-Content` for repository files because it can change encoding.

## Validation before handoff

Before considering code work complete:

1. Run `dotnet build` from the repository root.
2. Run `dotnet test` from the repository root.
3. Confirm public API changes are reflected in the API references and related package docs.
4. For changed code, use a code-review agent with `model: gpt-5.5` before committing.

Documentation-only changes do not require a build or test run unless they affect generated docs, examples that are compiled, or documented public API behavior.

## Git and PR rules

- Do not commit without explicit user approval.
- Do not push branches.
- Do not create or merge pull requests.
- Do not amend commits, rebase pushed history, or force-push unless the user explicitly asks and confirms the history is safe to rewrite.
- If asked for a PR summary, output this copy-paste-ready format:

````markdown
**Title:** <short PR title>

```markdown
<full PR body>
```
````

## Pre-commit checklist

Before committing any changes after explicit approval:

1. Confirm required validation has passed.
2. Confirm the diff contains only intended changes.
3. Run a code-review agent with `model: gpt-5.5` for changed code and address substantive findings.
4. Present the final summary to the user.
