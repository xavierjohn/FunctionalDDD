/// <para>
/// Endpoints without this attribute pass through the middleware with zero overhead. Apply at the
/// method level for fine-grained opt-in, or at the class / controller level to opt every action
/// in by default. The attribute is read from <c>Endpoint.Metadata</c> at request time, so both
/// MVC and Minimal-API endpoints honour it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The attribute is not inherited: endpoint metadata reflects the closest declaration that
/// produced the endpoint, and silently propagating idempotency processing to derived controllers
/// is a security and correctness footgun (the derived controller may not have been audited for
/// safe replay).
/// </para>

/// <example>
/// <code>
/// [HttpPost("orders")]

/// public Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; CreateOrder([FromBody] CreateOrderRequest request) =&gt; ...;
