# Trellis.Mediator

[![NuGet Package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Trellis.Mediator.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Trellis.Mediator)

Result-aware pipeline behaviors for [Mediator](https://github.com/martinothamar/Mediator) that keep handlers focused on business work.

## Installation
```bash
dotnet add package Trellis.Mediator
```

## Quick Example
```csharp
using Mediator;
using Trellis;
using Trellis.Mediator;

public sealed record GetOrderQuery(string Id) : IQuery<Result<string>>, IValidate
{
    public IResult Validate() =>
        string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Id)
            ? Result.Fail(new Error.InvalidInput(EquatableArray.Create(new FieldViolation(InputPointer.ForProperty(nameof(Id)), "validation.error") { Detail = "Order ID is required." })))
            : Result.Ok();
}

builder.Services.AddMediator(opts => opts.ServiceLifetime = ServiceLifetime.Scoped);
builder.Services.AddTrellisBehaviors();
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use `ServiceLifetime.Scoped` when calling `AddMediator(...)` in a host with a request scope. The Trellis behaviors are scoped (they depend on per-request services); the Mediator default of `Singleton` will fail ASP.NET's root-scope validation as soon as the first behavior tries to resolve a scoped dependency.

## Key Features
- Adds validation, authorization, tracing, logging, and exception behaviors that understand `Result<T>`.
- Short-circuits failures before handlers do unnecessary work.
- Unified `ValidationBehavior` composes `IValidate` + every `IMessageValidator<TMessage>` (e.g., the `Trellis.FluentValidation` adapter) and aggregates failures into one response.
- Supports resource authorization with explicit or assembly-scanned registration.
- **Domain event dispatch**: implement `IDomainEventHandler<TEvent>`, register with `AddDomainEventDispatch(...)`, and the framework fires events from `IAggregate.UncommittedEvents()` after a successful command handler whose response is an `IResult<TAggregate>` (typically `Result<TAggregate>`) where `TAggregate : IAggregate`. Other response shapes (`Result<Unit>`, `Result<TDto>`, `Result<(A,B)>`) pass through untouched in v1; for those, call the post-commit-only `IDomainEventPublisher.DispatchAggregateEventsAsync(aggregate, ct)` helper from a handler that owns its own commit or a `BackgroundService` tick. Non-cancellation handler exceptions are logged and swallowed so side effects never break the originating request; `OperationCanceledException` matching the request's token is the one exception that propagates so the caller can abort cleanly.
