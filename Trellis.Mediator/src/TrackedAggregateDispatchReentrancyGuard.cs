/// The flag MUST be stored on a non-generic type because static fields on a generic class are
/// per-closed-generic. A re-entrant nested command typically resolves a different
/// <c>Behavior&lt;TMessage, TResponse&gt;</c> closed type (different command, different response),
/// and a per-closed-generic <see cref="AsyncLocal{T}"/> would default to <see langword="false"/>
/// in that nested closed generic — bypassing the guard. Routing every closed behavior through this
/// shared cell ensures the guard observes re-entrancy regardless of nested message shapes.
