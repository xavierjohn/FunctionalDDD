/// Domain events are a key tactical pattern in Domain-Driven Design that enable:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Loose coupling between aggregates and bounded contexts</item>
/// <item>Temporal decoupling of side effects from core business logic</item>
/// <item>Event sourcing and audit trails</item>
/// <item>Integration between microservices</item>
/// <item>Communication of state changes to external systems</item>

/// <para>
/// Best practices for domain events:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Name events in the past tense (e.g., OrderSubmitted, PaymentProcessed)</item>
/// <item>Make events immutable - use readonly properties or init-only setters</item>
/// <item>Include all relevant data needed by handlers to avoid querying</item>
/// <item>Keep events focused on domain concepts, not technical implementation</item>
/// <item>Use <see cref="OccurredAt"/> for the event timestamp - avoid redundant timestamp fields</item>

/// Domain events vs. Integration events:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><strong>Domain events</strong>: Internal to the bounded context, raised by aggregates</item>
/// <item><strong>Integration events</strong>: Published across bounded contexts, may be derived from domain events</item>

/// <code>
/// // Define domain events as immutable records with OccurredAt as the timestamp.

/// // through serialization (e.g., outbox tables, integration buses, audit projections).

/// public record OrderSubmitted(OrderId OrderId, Money Total, DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;
/// 
/// // Raise events from an aggregate. Use TimeProvider.GetUtcNow() (typically injected)
/// // so tests can pin time deterministically with a fake clock.

    /// does not block this at the type level. Always author events from <see cref="TimeProvider.GetUtcNow"/> or
    /// <see cref="DateTimeOffset.UtcNow"/> to avoid local-time stamping on non-UTC machines. A static analyzer to
